## Contributing

If you have a remix license, then make sure you run install with
`REMIX_REGISTRY_TOKEN` env variable set.

If you do not have a remix license, you will not be able to install dependencies
and run the project locally. However, you _can_ work on the frontend components
in the `storybook` directory. See `storybook/README.md` for more information.
