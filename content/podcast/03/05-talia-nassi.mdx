What does it mean to test in production? Simply put, testing in production means
testing your features in the environment where your features will live. So what
if a feature works in staging, that's great, but you should care if the feature
works in production, that's what matters.

An excellent tool for testing in production is feature flagging. Feature
flagging allows you to separate your code deployment from your feature release.
So, when you use a tool like future flagging, you're able to target specific
users to see your feature, and you can test your feature and make sure it works
and fix any bugs.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Hello, friends, this is your friend Kent C. Dodds, and I am
super excited to be here with my friend, Talia Nassi. Say Hi, Talia.

**Talia Nassi:** Hi, guys.

**Kent C. Dodds:** So Talia and I are new friends, just in the last few months,
I met Talia on Twitter through some, I think it was tweets about the talk that
we're going to talk about a little bit, but I was just really interested in some
of the things that Talia has to say and I'm super excited for her to share those
things with you. But before we get to that, I want you to get to know Talia. So
Talia, could you just introduce yourself to everybody and let's get to know you
a little bit?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, absolutely. So I'm Talia, I'm a Dev Advocate at Split,
and my background is mostly in testing, in software testing. I started out in QA
and I've worked in automation and QA in places like Visa, and then Forbes, and
then WeWork. So I have a really strong testing background and that's where I
kind of found this passion of testing and production. My favorite language is
Python, and I'm also an office prankster, so if you've seen me in the office
wrapping things, or playing with people's desks, I definitely like pulling
pranks on people. So, if I haven't gotten you, then I will, don't worry, but
it's kind of a crazy time right now and no one can get into the office, so.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Well, when the office is back open again, then you can sneak
in early before anybody else and just like saran wrap everybody's desk or
something.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for someone's birthday, a couple of years ago
I wrapped his entire desk in newspaper. It was fantastic. It took me so long
though.

**Kent C. Dodds:** That's super fun. It sounds like you'd be a fun person to
work with.

**Talia Nassi:** I am.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Very cool.

**Talia Nassi:** I am [inaudible 00:01:56] your tech starts working again.

**Kent C. Dodds:** I definitely learned valuable lessons about locking my
machine anytime I left my desk. You learn that pretty quick on the job you get
desktop backgrounds of My Little Pony and whatever else.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, exactly.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Well good stuff. So Talia, so you actually started in the QA
engineer side. Did you start with manual testing or did you start with automated
testing on the QA side?

**Talia Nassi:** So I started with manual testing and that was at Visa and the
reason was because they have a lot of audits and you have to document all of
your test cases and you have to document all of your findings and there's a
really kind of strict process of which test cases that you ran and which test
cases passed. So it's a really vigorous manual process, but you get to learn a
lot about the testing documentation that's expected for you to know. So because
of that I can write a really great test strategy document and I can write a
really great test report because of that foundation. And after that I was able
to have that foundation to be able to do more automated testing. So I started
with manual and then after Visa it was basically just automation.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Hm, yeah. So the reason I ask is I almost got my start into
QA when I got into things, because one of my first internships I got, I barely
slipped in. This guy was like, "I can't give you a job but I want you here so
I'll find you something." And they found me a QA position and then just through
certain happenstance I ended up being a business intelligence engineer that
didn't work out either. But so, I remember working with other QA manual testers
and they knew the product upside down backwards. They knew so much more than
anybody else about the product and I found that to be really interesting just
through their experience of testing literally every case. Well you kind of
alluded to this, but your experience as a manual tester has impacted your
empathy with the user or your ability to understand what is important in the
process of testing in an automated way?

**Talia Nassi:** I think just being a tester in general and being responsible
for executing the test cases, you are the person who should know the product
inside and out because when you're a developer and you're implementing the code
for the functionality, I feel like that's just a little part of a big puzzle.
But when you're writing end to end test cases or you're running integration
tests or whatever the tests are, you have a more big picture kind of outlook. So
you are expected to know what's supposed to work how, because, in my opinion, I
think the tester and the product person should be best friends. You should know
the requirements from the product person and if you have questions you should
talk to them. I always think that QA and product should be sitting right next to
each other, they should be talking the most, they should have the most meetings
together. They need to be in sync the most because you're testing someone else's
product requirements.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And you mentioned something
that just made me think about this. And so with developers, lots of us are
really proud of the unit tests that we write and we're like sweet, this button
is so well tested, but then the QA are like, "I don't care how well tested
button is, the page isn't working. I can't check out. This is a problem." Have
you ever noticed a difference in the way that you view testing from other
developers and just the way that you've done it?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, absolutely. Some developers I've worked with will
absolutely hate testing and they'll just tell me, "I don't want to write a test.
I'm not writing for this." So I think it's just about having them understand you
don't want things to come up in the future. You want to know that your product
and your features are working right now and you don't want to be reactive rather
than being like proactive and just testing whatever you need to test now. But
yeah, there's definitely so many personalities. There's developers that I've
worked with who write tests for everything. They write a million unit tests and
a million integration tests and end to end test. And then there's developers who
refuse to write any tests. It's a little hard, but they learn. After working
with me, they learn.

**Kent C. Dodds:** You end up wrapping their desks in newspaper and whatever
else.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, yeah.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Very good. I'm actually curious, so I have some opinions on
where you get the most value for the time that you put into when we're testing
and so we have that traditional testing pyramid where it's like ETE top
whatever, and I kind of throw that away. I don't buy into that idea. And so I
created what's called a testing trophy. And I don't know if you've noticed that
or seen that before, but end to end tests are a little more valuable than you'd
see in the pyramid. A unit tests are still useful, but they're not the biggest
part of the trophy. The biggest part is the integration tests. And I'm curious
since you mentioned there some developers will write thousands of units and
integration and where do you see the most value for the effort when we're
talking about these different layers of tests?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, I think you get the most value from end to end test and
that's because you're thinking like the user, like how would your end user
interact with your product? How is the end user going to go through your website
or your app? So you're putting yourself in the position of your customer and
when you do these end to end tests, you're thinking in a different persona. So I
think that's what gives me the most value. And I generally would spend more time
on end to end tests then unit tests or integration tests, but they're all
important. I just think end to end tests give you the most value.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, I definitely agree with you there that a single end to
end test provides you with way more useful information than a single of any
other type. So yeah, I totally buy into that. So I'm curious, before we get to
the tools, I want to bring up this other unique aspect, which is kind of the
thing that turned me on to this idea in the first place, and this was your talk
that you gave at Nordic JS 2019, and I think maybe you've given it a couple of
times, but it's a testing in production and this is marvelous and I don't want
to mess it up so I'll go ahead and let you explain what this is. What does it
mean to test in production and why should people care about this?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. Okay, great. So testing in production means testing your
features in the environment that your features will live in. It means testing
your features where your users will use those features. So it means not using a
dummy environment, staging and not using a test environment. It means you're
testing your code in production and you're doing it safely. And the reason that
you should do this is because I don't care if my feature works in staging,
that's great, but I care if my feature works in production, and that's what
really matters. So I think a lot of people are scared and hesitant when it comes
to this topic. But if you do it correctly and safely and you use the right
tools, it really is super beneficial.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Absolutely, and I think this is brilliant. So one of my
biggest guiding philosophies for everything that I do with testing is this
concept that the more that your test resemble the way your software is used, the
more confidence they can give you.

**Talia Nassi:** Absolutely.

**Kent C. Dodds:** And the way that your test would resemble the way software is
used is like you're a manual tester actually filling out the form, but we don't
do that. I mean people do that, but we want to automate this because it scales
better. We can't just run every permutation on every change. I worked at a
company where we did that. Development was shut down for two days. It was not
fun for anyone. And humans are notoriously bad at that, especially developers
who just want to get back to their regular jobs.

**Kent C. Dodds:** So then we automated, but as soon as we automate, we take a
step away from that as the closer your test resemble the way software is used,
but it's worthwhile. And so every step that we take away from that, we're kind
of trading off confidence for some sort of ease or ... what's the word I'm
looking for? Convenience.

**Talia Nassi:** Yes.

**Kent C. Dodds:** But when hearing about your idea of let's run our tests in
production, that's like, "Yeah, sure. Why not?" There's no real value in
actually running it in staging. So long as you are using the proper tools and
you're testing safely. And so I want to dig into that a little bit, but that
gets us one step closer to the way our software is used, which [crosstalk
00:11:58] confidence.

**Talia Nassi:** Exactly. Yeah. Because your users and your customers, they
don't go into your staging environment and use your product staging, they use
your product in production. So it just makes so much more sense to me to test in
production. I didn't know about testing in production. I didn't use it. I only
tested in staging up until I had an interview at a company a couple years ago
and they told me that they test in production and that's how I got into it
because I started working at that company, but I was just like everyone else who
didn't know about this thing and was so freaked out about it at first and now
I'm talking about it.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things where it's like, well
this is just the way that we do it. You don't know that it could be better.

**Talia Nassi:** Exactly.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Now this is just life. So I'm really interested to dig into
some of the methods to this and hopefully we've established for the people
listening why this is beneficial. It should make total sense that if you test in
production that's more realistic. The first thing that I want to ask though is
how do you know it's safe to deploy code if you don't wait to test it until
after it's deployed? I think that's probably the biggest question that I have
about this.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. So there is a magic little thing that's called feature
flagging, and feature flagging allows you to separate your code deployment from
your feature release. So if you think about a bubble and you think about the
specific people being put into that bubble and having your feature also being
put in that bubble, only the people who are in that bubble can see that feature.
So when you use a tool like future flagging, you're able to target specific
users to see your feature and you can test your feature and make sure it works
and fix any bugs. And then once you know that it's working in production, then
you pop the bubble or you turn on the feature flag, so that the entire world can
see this feature.

**Talia Nassi:** It really provides a safe way to test your code in production
because if there's a bug or something's wrong, your real end users aren't going
to see that issue because they're not targeted in the flag. So this is kind of a
layer of protection that says I'm going to give you a little bit of production
space and in that space you can do whatever you want and you're not going to
affect anyone.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, that makes so much sense. So none of this testing and
production would be a really feasible thing without feature flags. But of course
this isn't the only benefit to feature flags, there are so many benefits. Do you
want to talk about why feature flags are such a good idea?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. Feature flags allow you to do so many different things.
Some of the things that I've used feature flags for are just to have a kill
switch in case something goes wrong. So if I release something and I don't know,
two weeks later there's a huge bug and I need to kill that feature, I can use
feature flags to turn that feature off. I've also used it for AB testing. So if
I'm working with a product owner and he decides, "I don't know if I want this
product to work in this way or in that way." So we do an experiment and we test
both ways and we see which one gives us a higher conversion rate. You can also
use feature flags to migrate your monolith to microservices, do it safely in a
controlled manner.

**Talia Nassi:** There's so many things, but obviously I have a testing
background, I'm passionate about the testing side of it.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, absolutely. So you have a blog post about this specific
for React and I think that it is for anybody who's not already used to feature
flags. I think for lots of companies, feature flags are just a fact of life. But
there's probably plenty of companies that haven't done any feature flags before
or maybe some people who aren't really happy with the way they're doing it.
There's a quick blog post that we'll add to the show notes for people to take a
look at to learn about feature flags.

**Kent C. Dodds:** So you have the feature flags in place and for the test. You
just enable it for the test and the test can run with the feature enabled and
then eventually the feature flag goes away and you just continue to test in
production.

**Talia Nassi:** Right, so something that I generally recommend to do is to
create test users that will be in production and you can target them inside of
your flag. So if you have whatever automation framework that you use, you can
automate so that your test user that's in the flag, gets the same treatment as a
normal user would. And then once you're done testing, once you turn the feature
flag on, then your test will continue running in the same way because your user
was already targeted in that flag. So you don't have to make any changes, you
don't have to update the test because you used the same test user that was
targeted inside of the future flag.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah. Perfect. That's awesome. So another question that I
have about testing and production is so I talk about this, the better your test
resembles the way software is used, whatever, but at some point you do have to
mock things out. When we're doing these integration tests or end to end tests,
we want to have some sort of mocking so that if I am testing the checkout flow,
I'm adding products to my cart, I've got like \$2,000 worth of stuff in my cart
and I go to checkout, I don't want my credit card to be the one that we're
entering into that credit card information because those are very expensive
tests. So what is the solution for that kind of scenario? Because in a staging
environment you can have it point to a different Stripe thing or whatever for
your testing, but in production it should be hitting the production Stripe or
whatever credit card processing you do. So how do you work around that when
you're testing in production?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. Yeah. Great. Okay. So there's a couple of things. So the
first thing is when you're working with third parties, I would say work with a
third party and let them know, "Hey, we're going to test. We're going to start
testing in production, so if you get any requests from these users, these are
test users, don't actually process the transaction or use another card or
whatever." You can work with the third parties. You can also set up a header on
the API request that you send to them and say, "Hey, if you get anything with
this specific, holler if you see this, just mark this as a test or do whatever.
You can work with them to make something that works for you. I would also say if
it's something that you absolutely can not test in production, you can use a
Canary release and just release it to a very, very small population and you can
gain confidence in that and then slowly roll it out to everyone.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Hm.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, that makes sense. So at some point, if you really can't
make anything else work, then just releasing to a very small set of people, they
can be your guinea pigs. It's the best you can do in that scenario.

**Talia Nassi:** Right. So then you would still use staging and test as much as
you can and then release it to production, but only to a very small population.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Sure. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Cool. And actually, I
hadn't ever considered actually just talking to the third party and being like,
"Hey, we want to test."

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, when you're doing business with them, you guys should
work together.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Very cool. So great.
So we've got our tests running in production. What are some of the tools that
you have used to do these tests in production or getting down to the specific
tools that we're using?

**Talia Nassi:** Cool. So for feature flagging, I've used Split and
LaunchDarkly. For automation, I mean you definitely need to have an automation
framework in place when you're testing in production. It's just the test. You're
in a really high risk environment. You don't want to have to test everything
manually. So I've used Robot Framework, Puppeteer with Jest and also Protractor.
And then you also need a job scheduler. So like Jenkins or CircleCI or Travis
and then some sort of alerting system that will alert you when a test fails, so
PagerDuty or even just like a Slack message. Yeah, those are the main tools that
you need.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Well what is your preferred tool for authoring these end to
end tests?

**Talia Nassi:** So for automation, just specifically for the test, I love Robot
Framework. That's my favorite testing framework ever. It's just so easy to use.
They have a keyword driven testing approach. So even if you're not a developer,
even if you don't know specifics of syntax or you're not a developer full time
or whatever it is, Robot Framework is so easy to learn and it just makes the
most sense because you can work with product people and designers and they don't
have to understand code to understand your tests, so that's my favorite. I love
Robot. Shout out to Robot Framework.

**Kent C. Dodds:** And it helps that it's implemented in Python, which happens
to be your favorite language.

**Talia Nassi:** How cool is that?

**Kent C. Dodds:** Cool. Another thing that just popped into my mind is a
challenge that I've had when I'm testing, as I closed the gap between my test
and the reality of the world, is registration. So when I register, typically
there's going to be an email flow before I get an activated account or
something. Have you ever come across that particular scenario and how do you
solve for that?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, so in that case, I would not automate those flows. I
would test those manually, but I would still create test users to use. I just
wouldn't automate those.

**Kent C. Dodds:** I see. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool. Yeah. In the past
I typically took a couple of different approaches like either just automatically
enable those users or activate those users or have the email and go to some
other service that automatically clicks the link or something.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, that would work.

**Kent C. Dodds:** But it's so much work.

**Talia Nassi:** We've done similar things where if we're testing in production
and it's supposed to send a confirmation email or something, something is
supposed to get sent to the end user, we'll just write a little thing in our
code that says if the request comes from this user, don't send the email. Or
once we test it manually a few times and we know that it's working, we'll put
that little thing in there.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah. Yeah. I think that sometimes people want to have a rule
that's always applies and it's perfect and we're in a perfect world and as great
as that would be, it's just all a big bucket of trade offs. Either a ton of work
and maybe it's pretty flaky versus maybe taking a small shortcut to make it more
practical.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah. Yeah. Now that you said flaky, I hate the word flaky
tests. I think either a test works and it does what it's supposed to do or
there's something wrong with the code or there's something with the test.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Hm.

**Talia Nassi:** I don't like it.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Let's dig into that a lot because I know that a lot of people
when they think ETE, they think flake. And I have a similar feeling around that
as you described, but what are some of the strategies that you've implemented to
make tests less flaky?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, I think the most important thing is to just make sure
that your test runs continuously and it doesn't fail. So like if I'm a tester
and I'm writing a test and it's failing for me, I'm not going to upload that to
Jenkins so that it can fail for everyone else. I'm going to make sure it works
for me and it works consistently. And after I watch the test run and pass 20, 50
times, then I'll upload it to Jenkins and it'll run with the rest of the build
pipeline. But if a test fails, it should be because there's something wrong. It
should be because there's a bug or there's something going on. It shouldn't be
the case where a test fails and everyone thinks, "Oh, there's something wrong
with the test." So yeah, that's my 2 cents.

**Kent C. Dodds:** People end up ignoring the tests and turning them off, which
is not what we want either. That makes a lot of sense. All right, well, Talia, I
feel like there was one other thing that was just in the back of my mind that I
really wanted to ask you and talking about flakiness just got me. Oh, oh
actually, it was I think that part of the problem with flakiness is the tools
that people have been using in the past. I've never used Robot Framework before,
but I transitioned from Selenium to Cypress and that was a night and day
difference.

**Talia Nassi:** Good. Yeah. [inaudible 00:25:36].

**Kent C. Dodds:** I don't know how many people are fans of Selenium at this
point. So yeah, improve testing frameworks can help with that flakiness too. And
another thing that occurs to me, is that when I was doing lots of end to end
tests in staging, I don't have a product anymore, so I don't do a whole lot of
end to end tests on products anymore, but half of the time when the test was
being flaky, it wasn't the test, it was the environment that I was working in.
We were always just like, "Well, it's staging, so who cares?" But if you're
testing in production, then that actually is really important information that
the test can tell you that you've got a flaky environment.

**Talia Nassi:** Exactly. Yeah. One of the things I talk about in my
presentation also is that because the environments are different and because the
data is different in both places, the test results will most likely be
different. So if a test passes in staging, it doesn't mean that it's going to
pass in production and vice versa. The load also in production doesn't match
staging. There's just so many differences and it's just better to know that your
feature is working in the place that your users are going to use it.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah, absolutely. And you probably have more resources
dedicated to keeping production up and so your tests are probably going faster
and then if they ever go slow, then you're like, "Oh, that actually means
something to me." It's not just like, "Oh, we have a really slow staging
environment." It actually like, "Oh wow, something happened in production. Let's
go fix that."

**Talia Nassi:** Exactly.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Just so much confidence. I love that. That's awesome. All
right, well, Talia, as we get down to the end of our time here, is there
anything else that you wanted to mention that we haven't gotten to hear yet?

**Talia Nassi:** The biggest thing is I would say just don't be scared of
testing in production. If you do it correctly and safely, it's really
beneficial. And obviously, I'm here for questions and yeah, just don't be
scared. Just try it.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Another thing that occurs to me about testing in production,
or let's pretend you're a developer today and you're like, "I have no end to end
tests. How am I ever going to do this?" That's always the biggest challenge is
how do I get started with this? It's just such a huge thing. But if you have got
an app in production, then that is the easiest thing to start testing because
you don't need to worry about provisioning some weird extra environment or
getting some extra CI thing or whatever else. It's all just you've got an app
and it's up and running and just start hitting that app for tests.

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, exactly. And if you have to set up an automation
framework, like Robot Framework, and I know Cypress also is just really easy
setup, so you don't have to worry about extra time for setup and then training
people. It's just super intuitive.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Yeah. Yeah, it's a good world that we live in now. All right,
so for the homework for everybody as we just wrap things up here, we have two
items of homework. The first is to watch Talia's talk, testing in production. It
is a great talk. You'll enjoy that. And then the second one is to read the blog
post about how to set up feature flags with React in 10 minutes. That's on the
split.io/blog and the link will be in the notes here. So those are your pieces
of homework. It shouldn't take you a whole lot of time and I think that you'll
enjoy doing that. Talia, what's the best place for people to reach out to you if
they want to ask you any questions or anything?

**Talia Nassi:** Yeah, if you want to reach out to me on Twitter, you can do
that. It's just my first name, underscore, last name, Talia_Nassi and also email
me Talia.Nassi@split.io.

**Kent C. Dodds:** Awesome. Cool. Thank you so much. This has been such a good
time. Hope everybody's doing awesome and we will catch you all later. Thanks,
Talia.

**Talia Nassi:** Bye. Thank you.
