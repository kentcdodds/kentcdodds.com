    Even as a dev with many years of experience building production apps in
    React, I still learned a lot from EpicReact. The advanced patterns was

    There's a lot of stuff in this course I keep coming back to. The biggest
    takeaway for me has been how much it's helped me formalize my understanding
    in React. Kent offers first principles of React fundamentals and
    systematizing React composition patterns that help get a handle on React.

    I've been developing across the stack for around 5 years but there were
    always areas I never fully grasped.


    Going through EpicWeb.dev with Kent has shined a light on those unknown
    areas. 


    Finishing the course gave me the confidence to start my own agency and take
    on my first client! I couldn't have done it so quickly without the knowledge
    from EpicWeb, thank you Kent! 🚀

    I'm still in the first steps of EpicWeb but the platform alone says how much
    care and thought gone into it. When Kent says "it's not meant for passive
    consumption," he means it and delivers an awesome active learning
    experience. I've gone through multiple courses, but this one clearly raises
    the bar (and probably ruins others ones for me 😆). It kinda feels like
    coming back to a classroom with a teacher and exercises to be done in the
    best way possible.

    I can say that without a doubt, and I ain't kidding here, I wouldn't be
    where I am today in my career without Kent's dedication and penchant for
    creating amazing learning material. After almost 4 years of learning from
    him, you'd think I'd stop being surprised with how great a job he does
    developing courses, but here I am again, surprised and blown away by the
    experience I'm having on [EpicWeb.dev](https://www.epicweb.dev). The
    experience of learning on [EpicWeb.dev](https://www.epicweb.dev) is in a
    league of its own.

    Epic Web workshops covers almost all the aspects of web development to help
    you build your own apps using Remix. After going through the workshops I
    have much better understanding of the web platform in general.

    Kent's educational content has been a continual font of inspiration and
    knowledge for me to draw upon over the years. After years of work, I was
    promoted to Senior Engineer and he's been a cornerstone of my professional
    development, and I consider him a giant upon whose shoulders I proudly
    stand.


    So I'd like to thank Kent for all of his contributions to the industry, and
    for striving to make it - and the world - a better place.

    Just wanted to say I finished the full Epic React and am very happy with the
    results. I can finally understand a codebase I've been working on for a few
    years primarily written by another god-tier React developer.


    It was a super challenging codebase to follow before but Epic React touched
    on every essential concept and now I no longer feel lost.


    I had to re-train Front End after switching from Angular and I must say this
    class has made it possible for me to re-tool and re-skill without getting
    too discouraged by how much time it would normally take. THANK YOU KENT! You
    are an AMAZING teacher!
