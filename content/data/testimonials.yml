    EpicReact.dev is amazing! I knew almost immediately that the cost was
    justified. I'm self-taught, and Kent clearly and concisely filled in gaps in
    my knowledge and corrected assumptions I incorrectly relied on.

    This course gave me insight to testing like never before. We learned how to
    build an assertion library! And I haven't even finished it yet. The videos
    are really easy to code along and transcripts are a great read while
    travelling. Highly recommended to you and your colleagues.

    I can't say enough positive things about Epic React. I've not only improved
    so many gaps I've had with React but have finally found how I learn best,
    well, Kent figured it out with how he created this course. After the Epic
    React I felt confident enough to begin freelancing and just shipped my first

    Whilst job searching, I knew I had to improve my React skills beyond what
    I'd picked up doing my own projects. Thanks to Kent's workshop, I was able
    to fill in any gaps in my knowledge, which led to me being hired for my
    first Software Engineering role. His teachings are cohesive and objective,
    pointing out best practices and their inevitable drawbacks. I look forward
    to seeing his future work for the developer community!

    I've had the pleasure to attend Kent's - Advanced React Hooks, back in 2020
    and it was such a insightful course. Kent has a knack of breaking complex
    subjects which are easier for every developer to understand. His workshops
    are worth the investment Even topics like - Concurrency, memo, callbacks &
    effects, which would otherwise be daunting to completely comprehend, are
    simplified. Highly recommend his workshops and his website - epicreact.dev

    You can call me an Epic React 🥑 (Advocate), there is no better React course
    around. Kent's approach to teaching is the one that resonates the most with
    me. The pacing is amazing and he really focus on practice. This course
    helped me understand React at a much deeper level. It builds up in the
    fundamentals and progress extremely well into the advanced topics. Best
    course investment I made to date.

    level up my skills and help me grow in my career. I have gone through both
    EpicReact and TestingJavaScript, they have helped me tremendously, in words
    I can't even describe. In the 11th month of working, I got promoted from
    Junior to Mid.
