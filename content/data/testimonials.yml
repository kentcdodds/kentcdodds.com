    EpicReact.dev is amazing! I knew almost immediately that the cost was
    justified. I'm self-taught, and Kent clearly and concisely filled in gaps in
    my knowledge and corrected assumptions I incorrectly relied on.

    This course gave me insight to testing like never before. We learned how to
    build an assertion library! And I haven't even finished it yet. The videos
    are really easy to code along and transcripts are a great read while
    travelling. Highly recommended to you and your colleagues.

    I can't say enough positive things about Epic React. I've not only improved
    so many gaps I've had with React but have finally found how I learn best,
    well, Kent figured it out with how he created this course. After the Epic
    React I felt confident enough to begin freelancing and just shipped my first
    client site!

    I used Epic React not to just upskill myself but I took the knowledge gained
    from the course and added them to patterns I showed coworkers and mentees.
    The teaching and learning approach that the platform implements utilizes
    some of the best learning and memory techniques available from modern
    research in those fields.

    Whilst job searching, I knew I had to improve my React skills beyond what
    I'd picked up doing my own projects. Thanks to Kent's workshop, I was able
    to fill in any gaps in my knowledge, which led to me being hired for my
    first Software Engineering role. His teachings are cohesive and objective,
    pointing out best practices and their inevitable drawbacks. I look forward
    to seeing his future work for the developer community!

    I've had the pleasure to attend Kent's - Advanced React Hooks, back in 2020
    and it was such a insightful course. Kent has a knack of breaking complex
    subjects which are easier for every developer to understand. His workshops
    are worth the investment Even topics like - Concurrency, memo, callbacks &
    effects, which would otherwise be daunting to completely comprehend, are
    simplified. Highly recommend his workshops and his website - epicreact.dev

    You can call me an Epic React 🥑 (Advocate), there is no better React course
    around. Kent's approach to teaching is the one that resonates the most with
    me. The pacing is amazing and he really focus on practice. This course
    helped me understand React at a much deeper level. It builds up in the
    fundamentals and progress extremely well into the advanced topics. Best
    course investment I made to date.

    I was able to use what I learned from TestingJavaScript.com to make
    productive changes in the testing culture in the team. The small video
    lessons that focus on topics are convenient to search and find the answer to
    the specific problems I had with testing.
