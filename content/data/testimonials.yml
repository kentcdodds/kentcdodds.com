    I've had the pleasure to attend Kent's - Advanced React Hooks, back in 2020
    and it was such a insightful course. Kent has a knack of breaking complex
    subjects which are easier for every developer to understand. His workshops
    are worth the investment Even topics like - Concurrency, memo, callbacks &

    simplified. Highly recommend his workshops and his website - epicreact.dev

    Even as a dev with many years of experience building production apps in
    React, I still learned a lot from EpicReact. The advanced patterns was
    especially useful to me as it formalized some patterns I've seen in the wild
    but never really understood. There's a lot of stuff in this course I keep
    coming back to. The biggest takeaway for me has been how much it's helped me
    formalize my understanding in React. Kent offers first principles of React
    fundamentals and systematizing React composition patterns that help get a
    handle on React.
