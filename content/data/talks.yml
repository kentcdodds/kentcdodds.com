    Bring your wand and potions ingredients, because we're going to make liquid
    luck! In my career, I've worked extremely hard, but I've also experienced a
    lot of what some might call "luck." Some of what I've done is reproducible,
    and some of it is not. But I've learned a lot about how to increase my "luck
    surface area" and then make the most of the opportunities that come my way.
    In this talk, I'll share the ingredients I've used to make my own luck, and
    I hope it can help you make yours. Don't forget to bring your spell book!

    It's often said that the two hardest problems in programming are caching,
    naming things, and off by one errors. Some degree of caching is required in
    almost every application to drastically improve performance. Unfortunately,
    not only is it easy to get wrong, there are also lots of different layers
    and methods to implement caching with different trade-offs.


    In this talk, Kent will explain the key principles of caching. We'll go
    through several real world examples of issues where caching is a great
    solution. We'll also explore different approaches and their associated
    trade-offs. We'll cover a ton of ground here. This one's gonna be fun!

  description: >-
    Remix is a web framework that gives you the simple mental model of a
    Multi-Page App (MPA) but the power and capabilities of a Single-Page App
    (SPA). One of the big challenges of SPAs is network management resulting in
    a great deal of indirection and buggy code. This is especially noticeable in
    application state which Remix completely eliminates, but it's also an issue
    in individual components that communicate with a single-purpose backend
    endpoint (like a combobox search for example).


    In this talk, Kent will demonstrate how Remix enables you to build complex
    UI components that are connected to a backend in the simplest and most
    powerful way you've ever seen. Leaving you time to chill with your family or
    whatever else you do for fun 😎.

    The web. What started as a document sharing platform has evolved into an
    application platform. The web has been through a number of transformations
    over the years. From static HTML files to dynamic server-generated HTML
    responses. Then to REST or GraphQL APIs consumed by JavaScript-heavy clients
    with the Jamstack. The web is entering a completely new transformation.
    Modern infrastructure and techniques have changed the rules of what it means
    to make an excellent user experience. In this new future, what's old is new
    and what's modern is lacking.


    In this keynote, Kent C. Dodds will show you how this transformation will
    impact your user experience, your development productivity, and your
    business goals. The future of the web is distributed. It's faster. It's
    cheaper. It's exciting. Kent will show you what you can do to stay in front
    of it (and no, it's not web3).

    When implementing the design of a user interface, we often finish before
    remembering that not everyone's running the app's services locally on their
    device. There's going to be network latency, long running database queries,
    and large datasets that can slow down the experience. We can and should do
    everything we can to speed things up, but not all of this is within our
    control. This means we need to start thinking about pending states. But
    pending UI is terrible.


    In this talk, Kent will walk us through building a pending experience that
    is quite delightful. Ultimately taking advantage of React 18's new streaming
    APIs and a soon-to-be-released API in Remix to give a top-notch user and
    developer experience. Prepare to have your mind blown.

    One fun (sometimes frustrating) part of the web is that your application
    must run on countless variations of devices with different configurations,
    screen sizes, and capabilities. Over the years, technology has improved and
    we've been given some really awesome APIs to _enhance_ our applications to
    make them more useful despite the uniquely challenging (and awesome)
    distribution mechanism of the web.


    Unfortunately, when we use these new features of the web platform to
    _enable_ our application, we limit our application's usefulness to the
    trade-offs of those features which has surprisingly negative impacts (even
    if the device itself supports those features).


    In this talk, we're going to learn the true scope of Progressive Enhancement
    and what can be gained by using tools and techniques that allow features of
    the web to _enhance_ your user's experience rather than _enable_ it.

    The landscape of the web has evolved drastically since the first website was
    published to the World Wide Web in 1991. Over the years, the pendulum has
    swung from servers rendering HTML to JavaScript-heavy clients and now it's
    swinging toward something more in the middle.


    What about the web today is enabling us to overcome the shortcomings of the
    web of the past? In this talk, we'll get a little peak into the history of
    each of these stages of the web and what that means for anyone building on
    the web platform in the future.

    When a brilliant idea strikes, you want to hit the ground running and focus
    on building out your idea. Unfortunately, for any ambitious project, it
    takes a significant amount of time configuring the tools you'll ultimately
    need to make your idea a reality. Far too often we either under prepare and
    our MVP-shortcuts end up being a pain in the neck for the next few years if
    we're successful, or we spend so much time in the setup process that we lose
    all motivation.


    In this talk, I'll show you how Remix can help you get started with a solid
    foundation so you can focus on building out your ideas. And when your MVP
    turns into a money maker, you won't feel like you have to rewrite your app
    from scratch! And for those of you starting new projects from scratch on a
    regular basis, I'll show you how you can make your own Remix stack to create
    these projects just like you want them again and again.

    can be quite simple and secure. This is more (and better) than just:
    "Install this library and you're good to go." When we're done we'll have our
    own auth code that can evolve with our ever-changing requirements without a
    need to learn some library-specific APIs. We'll be leveraging the Web
    Platform the way it was meant to be done to give us simple and secure
    server-side authentication for the web.

    The web has been able to do mutations for a really long time and we've been
    `preventDefault`-ing in our JavaScript SPAs. But if you build your backend
    to support both the `fetch`-submit type of form submission as well as the
    default behavior, then you can make your app work without JavaScript or
    before the JavaScript has finished loading! Let's explore how Remix makes
    this possible.

    more. I'm using some of the coolest modern tech around including React,

    I want to take you on a tour of some of the highlights and talk about some

    Remix has me more excited about building better websites than anything else
    since I started using React back in 2015. I have so much to say about it,
    but for this blog post, we're going to remove as many distractions as
    possible and give remix the "super simple start" treatment. So, even though
    Remix has a fancy npm init remix thing you can run (which is much easier
    than what I'm going to show you), we're going to skip that and build a
    simple remix app from absolutely nothing to running so we can inspect each
    bit required to get it going.

    Humans are natural problem solvers and we're good enough at it that we've
    survived over the centuries and become the dominant species of the planet.
    Because we're so good at it, we sometimes become problem seekers too–looking
    for problems we can solve. Those who most successfully accomplish their
    goals are the problem eliminators. Let's talk about the distinction between
    solving and eliminating problems with examples from inside and outside the
    coding world.

    Application State Management is one of the hardest parts of building and
    maintaining React Applications. The number of options you have is numerous
    and the reason is that it's just such a hard problem with so many nuances
    and trade-offs. One thing that makes application state management harder is
    when we aren't thoughtful about how that state is organized and categorized
    in our app. There are different kinds of state and they require different
    approaches for management. When you try to treat all app state exactly the
    same is when problems come into play.


    Let's talk about what some of those categories are and how we can
    drastically simplify our application code and improve our app's performance
    by thinking about and organizing our state differently.

    Are you the kind of programmer who prefers to never see the same code in two
    places, or do you make liberal use of copy/paste? Many developers swear by
    the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy while others prefer to Write
    Everything Twice (WET). But which of these produces more maintainable
    codebases? I've seen both of these approaches lay waste to codebases and I
    have a new ideology I would like to propose to you: Avoid Hasty Abstractions
    (AHA). In this keynote, we'll talk about abstraction and how you can improve
    a codebase by applying and creating abstractions more thoughtfully as well
    as how to get yourself out of a mess of over or under-abstraction.

    For the last few years of using React, we as a community have been trying to
    solve the hard problem of application state management with React when we
    already had one all along. React itself is a state management library.


    You can use features and practices that have been a part of React for a long
    time and it will change the way you think about state management for your
    React apps. In other words: you probably don't need Redux, MobX, or any
    state management library other than React. Let's explore how that's possible
    and why you might want to think twice before reaching for an abstraction.

    The hooks honeymoon phase is over. We were able to overlook our confusion as
    a reasonable familiarity issue, but now it's time to get real about the
    pitfalls of React Hooks. Hooks lead to a better user experience and fewer
    bugs for sure, but without the right foundational understanding of them and
    certain JavaScript semantics, we'll probably cause other problems in the
    process of using hooks.


    In this talk, we'll explore some of the gotchas of using hooks, why those
    things are problems, and how to think about hooks so we develop an intuition
    for how to use hooks while avoiding the pitfalls.

    React  is a brilliant JavaScript library for building simple and complex
    user interfaces. In our eagerness to apply  React  to our most complex of
    problems and ship solutions today, we can get lost in the 🌲🌲🌲 forest of
    abstractions 🌲🌲🌲. When it comes to leveling up our skills in anything, I
    find the most effective method is to take a step back and understand the
    foundational fundamentals. To strip away all abstraction until what we're
    left with is the bare bones. [The better you understand an abstraction, the
    more effective you will be at using
    it.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1074724545003581440) In this

    One of the things I love about React is how easy it is to encapsulate UI
    code into a component. I love this because it makes reuse of those
    components easy. But is it easy? I've made my fair share of components that
    had to accept a bunch of props to handle a growing list of different use
    cases resulting in a complex render function full of conditional statements
    and a confusing API for people using this "reusable" component. Eventually
    it becomes too much and I had to make a new version of the same component to
    handle slightly different use cases. Lots of code/bug duplication there
    because my reusable component wasn't reusable enough.


    There are patterns that have emerged in React that allow you to promote code
    reuse without sacrificing the simplicity or flexibility of the component. In
    this talk we'll go over 5 of these patterns that will make your React
    components more useful.

    We want to make sure that when we ship new code, our users can use the
    application. The best way we've found to do that is to write automated tests
    that run before we deploy a new version of the app. But if our tests aren't
    doing exactly what the user will do, then how do we really know that things
    will work when users interact with our apps? Let's rethink what it means to
    ship applications with confidence and what it takes to get there. With
    improved tools and practices, we can be more certain that what we're
    shipping to our users will work the way it's intended.

    Learning React can be confusing. React is a library, but even more than
    that, React is an ecosystem of tools that you piece together to create a
    program. This is a powerful property of the React community, however that
    ecosystem can be frustratingly distracting when you're a newcomer trying to
    get your feet wet. The key to avoiding this frustration and confusion is to
    learn React (and its ecosystem) in the right order.


    In this talk, we'll go over what that order is and give a roadmap so you can
    have a vision of where you're going. Let's learn how to React!

    The open source community and ecosystem have made me a better software
    developer and helped me develop better software. I get to see how other
    people work. Other people get to see how I work. It encourages me to put
    forth my best effort, think critically about the software I'm creating, and
    ensure it has great documentation. It's also easier to develop software in
    an isolated environment like an open source project.


    In this talk, we'll see how open source can help improve your skills and
    improve the software that you create. This makes you a much more skilled,
    marketable, and gives you work that you can share with the public and
    contribute to the open source ecosystem.

    In this talk I teach React from scratch in a single `index.html` file with
    no magic up my sleeves. We start with a basic Hello World in vanilla
    JavaScript and incrementally iterate through React APIs and JSX. We continue
    with introducing more of React's APIs.

    I no longer care about: specificity, CSS linters, CSS preprocessors, vendor
    prefixing, removing unused CSS, finding CSS dependencies and dependents. I
    now care more about: whether it's fast enough, whether it's small enough,
    whether it's familiar enough. These are some of my trade-offs. Because I use
    CSS-in-JS. I've made trade-offs because I write HTML-in-JS. Despite these, I
    still do it, because the cost is minimal enough, and the benefit is great
    enough. Let's tell stories, talk use-cases, explore trade-offs, and inspire
    more innovation to make the CSS-in-JS trade-offs less trade-offy.

    The cry of JavaScript fatigue still echoes in the minds of developers
    everywhere as they try to wade through the waters of outdated blog posts,
    tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and GitHub repos. Just when things seem
    to start settling in JavaScript, something new comes to shake things up a
    little bit. I'll be you tour guide as we navigate through the tooling set up
    of a modern JavaScript project that's leveraging these tools in a way that
    actually enhances the experience of users using the project and developers
    working on it.

    The more code you have, the more problems you have. One of these is the
    ability to learn the code. Code often has logic to handle edge cases which
    can distract a new contributor from the core logic of the code, making it
    challenging to learn. Another one of the problems with more code that's
    specific to JavaScript and the browser is the more you send over the wire to
    the browser, the slower it goes. This is due to network latency primarily,
    but also parsing, evaluating, and keeping relevant variables in memory.


    With a really interesting technique called [program
    slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing), we can build tools
    to help to mitigate some of these problems. In this talk, I'm going to give
    you a peek at a tool I've been working on called `slice-js` 🍕. I'm super
    excited about the implications for a project like this!

    Building things so they work well in isolation, then piece them together to
    make the full application makes building applications easier. One thing that
    really helps with this kind of strategy is to open source your stuff. In
    this talk, we'll take a look at an existing application, identify a good
    candidate component for open sourcing, and then go through the process of
    creating an open source project for that component and add it as a project
    dependency. By the end that component of the application will be easier to
    work on and contribute to and we'll also have it open for the rest of the
    world to contribute and improve the software which once had bugs that were
    just as private as the original project repository.

    Awesome! You've made it big! You've published an open source project and
    people are actually using it to make the world a better place. Achievement
    unlocked! Great job! But wait... what's this? An issue? Oh, it's just a bug.
    Pretty quick and easy. Fixed, released, done, #likeaboss 😎. What's this? A
    PR? How cool! Wait... That's not quite right... Oh, a question! Cool! And
    another! And another... eh... and another... Uh oh... You think you've just
    sold your soul to this project.


    You start an open source project to scratch your own itch and suddenly other
    people start using it and they need your help. This can easily start eating
    up your time big time and before you know it, your kids/dogs start feeling
    neglected.


    I've had to deal with this in a few projects and I've learned a thing or two
    about work/life/oss balance. I have a few tricks that help you make the
    project manage itself a bit more while still being friendly and helpful to
    users of the project. Let's chat.

    I hope you're excited about testing! We all know we need to get testing
    better, but it can be really hard to know how and what to test. We'll learn
    about the four inputs to React components (user input, props, data, and
    context) and how to test for each of them. You'll discover that if you
    slightly modify the way you're writing your components, you can make them
    much easier to test. We'll be using the new super fast, simple, and feature
    full Jest testing framework with enzyme and snapshot testing. I hope you
    like code. You're gonna see some here!

    ES6 Modules have been standardized and many have already started using them.
    They have a lot of benefits over CommonJS, AMD, and Globals.


    Unfortunately, there are many ways to deal with modules with this new syntax
    and it can be a bit confusing. In this talk, we'll explore the different
    ways you can use the new syntax and when you'd use the different methods.
    We'll also investigate what's going on at a high level. Buckle up for a
    firehose of ES6 information.

    "Feel free to submit a pull request." For some, this is a welcome
    invitation, but for many developers, pull requests are intimidating,
    discouraging them from contributing to the community. Kent Dodds
    demonstrates how easy and fun it is to create a pull request as a first
    timer.


    To open source newcomers: You, open source newcomer, can be a valuable
    contributor to the open source community. We need you here. We want your
    input and contributions. But getting over that initial hump of contributing
    can be a real challenge. I call this the first-timer's dilemma. You want to
    contribute, but you don't know how, or you're afraid your pull request (PR)
    won't get merged. You'll learn that it's less frightening and easier to get
    started than you think, as you become familiar with the common patterns and
    processes you need to understand in order to contribute to an open source
    project.


    To open source project maintainers: You, open source project maintainer, are
    the lifeblood of the open source community. Developers power open source.
    The more people finding, reporting, and fixing bugs or adding/removing
    features the better. You have the power to help newcomers overcome the
    first-timer's dilemma. You'll see what challenges first-timers often face
    and how with just a few extra minutes of your time, you can help tear down
    these barriers and make your project more friendly to contributors
    (including first-timers).


    Whether you'e new to open source or a pro, Kent will help you as we strive
    to make the open source community more open and friendly.

    Knowing what and how to test is almost more difficult than actually writing
    the test. If you write only end-to-end tests, you'll struggle with
    reliability and speed. If you write only unit tests, you'll struggle with
    surprising bugs integrating things together. In this ignite talk, we'll take
    these concepts away from code for a moment to see how we would test a wheel.

    trouble finding jobs because many companies are unwilling to hire and train
    them. So these new developers are left to themselves to try and find ways to
    develop the skills they need to be "marketable."


    I graduated from college in April 2014, just shy of two years ago. In that
    time, I've been able to learn a ton, build a bunch of stuff, teach
    workshops, create egghead screencasts, speak at conferences, and generally
    contribute quite a bit to the JavaScript community. In this talk, I'll cover
    some solid principles of things that I've learned in my experience. This

    they can help new-comers.

    Angular is amazing and has contributed to a major change in the landscape of
    frontend web development forever. But frameworks come and go. Even though
    Angular 1.x will still be around for a few years, it will eventually be
    totally antiquated and you'll need to show off other kinds of skills to
    attract employers. What if there were a way that you could learn skills you

    ReactJS is an amazing View library that promises (and delivers) high
    performance, composability, and maintainability. AngularJS is an amazing MV*
    framework. Tons of shops have adopted and totally bought into AngularJS for
    their entire frontend application. They're loving it, but some are finding
    that as these applications get bigger, they can become unwieldy,
    unperformant, and difficult to reason about. Many of these problems can be
    solved by doing things better with angular, but not all of them.


    In this talk, we'll go over why you don't need to re-write your whole
    application to get some of the wins of React and that it actually is quite
    easy to integrate the two. We'll talk about where it makes sense to bring in
    React to an existing Angular codebase and how it works well.

    I believe that people are so much more productive when they don't need to
    use the mouse to click on something. One implementation intended to help
    with this is keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately, these are limited to the
    number of sensible keys and key combinations and can be difficult for users
    to discover, remember, and use. Normally, only super users will ever use
    them. The goal of genie is to address the problems with keyboard
    combinations.


    Genie is a simple library to emulate the same kind of behavior seen in apps
    like Alfred (for macOS: [alfredapp.com](https://alfredapp.com)).
    Essentially, you register actions associated with keywords. Then you can
    request the genie to perform that action based on the best keyword match for
    a given keyword. This allows a user to type what they want to have happen
    and select from a list of the best matches for what they typed to perform an
    action. Over time, the genie will learn the actions more associated with
    specific keywords and those will be come first when a list of matching
    actions is requested. Check it out at

    If you're not careful (especially with your ng-repeats) your watch count in
    your app can grow pretty quick. This isn't a problem itself, but its what
    that does to your digest cycle. Lots of watchers makes your digest cycle
    take longer. In my talk, we'll talk about what Angular 1.3 is doing to help
    solve this problem, the problem their solution presents, a solution to that
    problem, and what can be done for pre-Angular 1.3 code.

    Cookies and sessions are the traditional way to keep track of user state on
    the server, but it can bite you later. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a stateless
    way to deal with users. I'll show how to use `$httpInterceptors` to make
    this easy as pie. :-)

    AngularJS is one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right
    now. If you haven't tried it yet, prepare to be amazed! Here's what we'll
    cover:

    1. Templates/Expressions - Your View

    2. Module - Your app's namespace

    3. Directives - DOM Interface

    4. Filters - Display utils

    5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?

    6. Controllers - The View Model

    7. Services - Common utilities

    8. Working with third-party modules

    9. Routing - Single Page App with state in the URL

    10. Firebase & AngularFire - A full web application with no server setup
    required!


    We'll be following through a repository hosted on GitHub. There's a branch
    for each concept, so you can play around with the code and then catch right
    back up with the next branch. So come on, and let's learn AngularJS!
