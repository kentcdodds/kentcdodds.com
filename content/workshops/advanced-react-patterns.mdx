### Learn how to build simple and flexible React Components and Hooks using modern patterns

Making React components and hooks that can be used in multiple places is not
hard. What is hard is when the use cases differ. Without the right patterns, you
can find yourself with a highly complex component or custom hook that requires a
lot of configuration props and way too many if statements.

With this workshop, you'll not only learn great patterns you can use but also
the strengths and weaknesses of each, so you know which to reach for to provide
your custom hooks and components the flexibility and power you need.

## Topics

- Use Context Controllers to improve context value maintenance
- Use the Compound Components Pattern to write React components that implicitly
  share state while giving rendering flexibility to the user
- Give simple control of state updates with a State Reducer
- Provide total logic control with the Controlled Props
- And more!

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks) or
  have the equivalent experience. You should be experienced with `useContext`
  and `useReducer` (experience with `useMemo` and `useCallback` is a bonus).
