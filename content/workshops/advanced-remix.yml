problemStatements:
  part1: Remix is a terrific tool for building simple websites
  part2: And it's even better for building complex web applications
  part3: >-
    What makes Remix special is the mental model is the same regardless of
    whether you're building a simple website on your own or complex business web
    application with teams of developers. And it does this with a lightweight
    abstraction on top of the web platform APIs. Remix scales down to simple
    stuff and up to the complex stuff.
  part4: >-
    It's the complex stuff we're going to be talking about in this workshop.
    Remix will ensure that you can keep things as declarative as possible and
    keep your app bug-free. And to make it even better, you can ship something
    simple that works well to start and iterate to the more complex solution
    without having to rearchitect everything because the mental model remains
    the same.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Mutations Mental Model
    description:
      Understanding how mutations work on the web is critical to building great
      user experiences for most web apps (it's great that a user can *see* the
      data, but can they *do* anything with it?). So we're going to get a grip
      on how to think about mutations with Remix (and the web) and how Remix
      helps you manage that.
  - title: Skip busy spinners when you can
    description:
      You know how when you favorite a tweet the heart turns red right away,
      even if you have a slow internet connection? Twitter has implemented
      what's called "Optimistic UI" for that experience. It makes you feel like
      the UI is snappier and you trust it more. We'll learn how to do that, and
      we'll also learn how to handle situations where our optimism was misplaced
      (like when the tweet you favorited was deleted 😅).
  - title: Build server-intelligent UI components
    description:
      As fun as it is to build reusable UI components, they often require a fair
      amount of wiring up to make them very useful for applications. We'll learn
      how to make reusable components that manage that server component as well.
      Pretty awesome productivity boost for product teams I'd say!
  - title: Create app-level navigation indicators
    description:
      Remix is your router as well as your framework, so it can give you
      everything you need to give the user awesome feedback and a smooth
      experience as they navigate around your app.
  - title: Accessibility with a focus on focus
    description:
      Focus management is one of the "side-effects" that React's `useEffect` was
      created for, and we'll learn how to use the hooks Remix gives you combined
      with `useEffect` to help get the user's focus where it needs to be, when
      it needs to be there.
topics:
  - Optimistic UI
  - Optimize Remix's automatic data revalidation
  - Data driven components
  - Navigation Indicators
  - Accessibility
  - Imperative data mutations
prerequisite: >-
  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) and watch my [Beginner's Guide
  to React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react) or have the equivalent experience.
  Experience with Remix is a bonus, but not a requirement. This workshop will
  use TypeScript, but should be completable if you do not have experience with
  TypeScript.
