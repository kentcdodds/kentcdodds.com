### Use advanced techniques to optimize ReactJS applications

We've built the first iteration of a React app, but now it's time to optimize
our app for performance and maintenance. In this workshop we’ll build upon the
application we built in the first part of this workshop
([Build ReactJS Applications](/workshops/build-react-apps)) and improve it using
proven tools and techniques. We’ll cover everything you're likely to run into
when building frontend React applications like application state management,
performance profiling and optimizations, and creating reusable components and
hooks.

  <Li checked>Profile application for performance optimizations</Li>
</List>

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [Build ReactJS Applications](/workshops/build-react-apps), or have
  equivalent experience building React applications with custom React components
  and the basic React hooks.
- Attend my [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or
  have the equivalent basic experience of using advanced hooks. You should be
  experienced with `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
