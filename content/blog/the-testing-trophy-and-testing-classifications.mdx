Allow me to indulge in a little personal history. If you're unfamiliar with the
testing trophy, here it is:

<div style={{backgroundColor: 'white', padding: 30, borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}>
  ![Illustration of a trophy separated into 4 sections labeled from top to
  bottom: End to End, Integration, Unit,
  Static](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1622744540/kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications/trophy_wx9aen.png)
</div>

I initially introduced this in a tweet with a quick drawing I made with Google
Drive:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/960723172591992832

I came up with this idea after publishing a blog post titled
["Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."](/blog/write-tests):

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/919931474828181505

Which was my take on [Guillermo Rauch's](https://twitter.com/rauchg) tweet from
about a year earlier:

https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/807626710350839808

I can't speak for Guillermo, but I agreed so strongly with what he said because
of my experience as a UI engineer and how I personally had come to understand
the term "integration" in this context.

Especially at that time in my career, almost all the code I wrote either ran
directly in a browser or was intended for a tool that would help me run code in
a browser. So for me naturally the terms "unit", "integration", and "end-to-end"
would be viewed through the lens of that experience. In fact, I added "static"
to the trophy because in the world of JavaScript that's not a given like it is
in the predominant languages when
[the testing pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html) was
introduced.

The reason I explain this background is to help you understand the way the
Testing Trophy is intended to be interpreted. I never considered whether it
applied to microservices or even backend services at all. I considered my
codebase in isolation and attempted to categorize the types of tests I could
write within the confines of my own code ownership. I always thought of
end-to-end tests as the place where you attempt to validate that things work
without any (or more practically "as little as possible") mocking in place.

So that left me with categorizing tests on my own code into either "unit" or
"integration". I consider a "unit" to be a single function, class, or object
that contains logic. So here's how I decided to (loosely) categorize them:

- Unit tests are those which test units which either have no dependencies
  (collaborators) or which have those mocked for the test.
- Integration tests are those which test multiple units integrating with one
  another.

Eventually, I created [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) to
encourage the kinds of testing practices that worked best for me:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/980799621080391680

By my own definition, Testing Library can be used to test individual React
components (unit tests), entire pages with HTTP requests mocked
[via MSW](/blog/stop-mocking-fetch) (integration tests), the full app with very
few mocks (end-to-end tests), and even
[individual React hooks](/blog/how-to-test-custom-react-hooks) if necessary
(lower level unit tests). And Testing Library is now the most popular and de
facto standard... er... testing library for React apps and increasingly the same
is happening wherever the DOM can be found. In May 2020,
[Testing Library received the "Adopt" distinction on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-testing-library).

I expect some will reply to this blog post with: "Why did you have to make up
your own definitions in the first place? Just use the ones that exist." So I'll
respond before you ask: "Which of the two dozen different definitions would you
like me to have chosen for my own definition?" üòÇ üò≠ In his post about
[test shapes](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2021-test-shapes.html),
[Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) approximates a quote of a
"test expert" who was asked in the 1990s how they define "unit test":

> ‚Äúin the first morning of my training course I cover 24 different definitions
> of unit test‚Äù.

This is a sad state of affairs, and it's been that way since the 90s
unfortunately. It is what it is. I had to choose something that made sense for
me and as an educator, I had to choose something that would make the most sense
for the people I'm teaching. Judging by the response from people who have
implemented my recommendations, my decision was a good one.

When discussing whether you can prove that testing is effective,
[Tim Bray](https://twitter.com/timbray) (in his article
[Testing in the Twenties](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021)),
correctly says:

> let's not kid ourselves that our software-testing tenets constitute scientific
> knowledge.

I would say this applies to everything about testing‚Äìnot just whether it's
effective (it can be). Any attempt to come to a single definition for all these
terms is a futile endeavor. I remember speaking at Assert(JS) (where I gave my
talk
[Write Tests. Not too many. Mostly Integration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fha2bVoC8SE&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf))
and I observed how wildly different each talk was with regards to their
recommendations on testing. But as I think about it now, I think lots of the
difference could be attributed to our definitions of the terms of testing and
less on how we strive to achieve confidence.

[Justin Searls](https://twitter.com/searls) (who incidentally also
[spoke at Assert(JS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4) that year)
said it best when he tweeted:

https://twitter.com/searls/status/1393385209089990659

Classification is important so we can have conversations about this. It's
unfortunate that you pretty much need to come to a consensus on how you define
these terms before having a productive conversation. But ultimately it really
doesn't matter. As Justin says, it's a distraction. Especially when so many
codebases are living life on the edge without an automated way to have
confidence their changes are safe to deploy.

## Conclusion

Anyway, hopefully this helps to clear things up a bit. To sum up: When trying to
apply the testing trophy to your situation, think of it within the code of an
individual codebase. It definitely has applicability in backends, but I've only
considered it for monoliths not microservices or even serverless functions (and
[I agree with Tim](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021),
most of us should probably be writing monoliths if we can).

The testing trophy (when understood) has given me (and countless other) clarity
on where to focus testing efforts. When properly interpreted, it helps me keep
this critical principle in mind:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106

This is the guiding principle for Testing Library and it's how I think about
every testing problem I face.

**Remember,** it's all about getting a good return on your investment where
"return" is "confidence" and "investment" is "time." If we had unlimited time,
then trying to classify things wouldn't be necessary, we'd just write tests
forever! But we don't, so I hope this helps you when trying to decide where to
put your efforts.
