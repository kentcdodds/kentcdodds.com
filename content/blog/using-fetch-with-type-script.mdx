When migrating some code to TypeScript, I ran into a few little hurdles I want
to share with you.

## The use case:

In [EpicReact.dev](https://epicreact.dev) workshops, when I'm teaching how to
make HTTP requests, I use the GraphQL Pokemon API. Here's how we make that
request:

```ts
const formatDate = date =>
  `${date.getHours()}:${String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0')} ${String(
    date.getSeconds(),
  ).padStart(2, '0')}.${String(date.getMilliseconds()).padStart(3, '0')}`

async function fetchPokemon(name) {
  const pokemonQuery = `
    query PokemonInfo($name: String) {
      pokemon(name: $name) {
        id
        number
        name
        image
        attacks {
          special {
            name
            type
            damage
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `

  const response = await window.fetch('https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/', {
    // learn more about this API here: https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: pokemonQuery,
      variables: {name: name.toLowerCase()},
    }),
  })

  const {data, errors} = await response.json()
  if (response.ok) {
    const pokemon = data?.pokemon
    if (pokemon) {
      // add fetchedAt helper (used in the UI to help differentiate requests)
      pokemon.fetchedAt = formatDate(new Date())
      return pokemon
    } else {
      return Promise.reject(new Error(`No pokemon with the name "${name}"`))
    }
  } else {
    // handle the graphql errors
    const error = new Error(errors?.map(e => e.message).join('\n') ?? 'unknown')
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
}
```

Here's an example usage/output:

```ts
fetchPokemon('pikachu').then(data => console.log(data))
```

this logs:

```json
{
  "id": "UG9rZW1vbjowMjU=",
  "number": "025",
  "name": "Pikachu",
  "image": "https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pikachu.jpg",
  "attacks": {
    "special": [
      {
        "name": "Discharge",
        "type": "Electric",
        "damage": 35
      },
      {
        "name": "Thunder",
        "type": "Electric",
        "damage": 100
      },
      {
        "name": "Thunderbolt",
        "type": "Electric",
        "damage": 55
      }
    ]
  },
  "fetchedAt": "16:18 39.159"
}
```

And for the error case:

```ts
fetchPokemon('not-a-pokemon').catch(error => console.error(error))
// Logs: No pokemon with the name "not-a-pokemon"
```

And if we make a GraphQL error (for example, typo `image` as `imag`), then we
get:

```json
{
  "message": "Cannot query field \"imag\" on type \"Pokemon\". Did you mean \"image\"?"
}
```

## Typing fetch

Alright, now that we know what `fetchPokemon` is supposed to do, let's start
adding types.

Here's how I migrate code to TypeScript:

1. Update the filename to `.ts` (or `.tsx` if the project uses React) to enable
   TypeScript in the file
2. Update all the code that has little red squiggles in my editor until they go
   away. Normally, I start with the inputs of the exported functions.

In this case, once we enable TypeScript on this file, we get three of these:

```
Parameter 'such-and-such' implicitly has an 'any' type. ts(7006)
```

And that's it. One for each function. So from the start it seems like this is
going to be a cinch right? lol.

So we fix all of those:

```ts [1,5,13]
const formatDate = (date: Date) => {
  // ...
}

async function fetchPokemon(name: string) {
  // ...
  if (response.ok) {
    // ...
  } else {
    // NOTE: Having to explicitly type the argument to `.map` means that
    // the array you're maping over isn't typed properly! We'll fix this later...
    const error = new Error(
      errors?.map((e: {message: string}) => e.message).join('\n') ?? 'unknown',
    )
    // ...
  }
}
```

And now the errors are all gone!

## Using the typed `fetchPokemon`

Sweet, so let's use this thing:

```ts
async function pikachuIChooseYou() {
  const pikachu = await fetchPokemon('pikachu')
  console.log(pikachu.attacks.special.name)
}
```

We run that and then... uh oh... Did you catch that? We've got ourselves a type
error ðŸ˜± `special` is an array! So that should be
`pikachu.attacks.special[0].name`. The return value for `fetchPokemon` is
`Promise<any>`. Looks like we're not quite done after all. So, let's type the
expected `PokemonData` return value:

```ts
type PokemonData = {
  id: string
  number: string
  name: string
  image: string
  fetchedAt: string
  attacks: {
    special: Array<{
      name: string
      type: string
      damage: number
    }>
  }
}
```

Cool, so with that, now we can be more explicit about our return value:

```ts
async function fetchPokemon(name: string): Promise<PokemonData> {
  // ...
}
```

And now we'll get a type error for that usage we had earlier and we can correct
it.

## Removing `any`things

Alright, let's get to that unfortunate explicit type for the `errors.map` call.
As I mentioned earlier, this is an indication that our array isn't properly
typed.

A quick review will show that both `data` and `errors` is `any`:

```ts
const {data, errors} = await response.json()
```

This is because the return type for `response.json` is `Promise<any>`. When I
first realized this I was annoyed, but after a second of thinking about it I
realized that I don't know what else it could be! How could TypeScript know what
data my `fetch` call will return? So let's help the TypeScript compiler out with
a little type annotation:

```ts
type JSONResponse = {
  data?: {
    pokemon: Omit<PokemonData, 'fetchedAt'>
  }
  errors?: Array<{message: string}>
}
const {data, errors}: JSONResponse = await response.json()
```

And now we can remove the explicit type on the `errors.map` which is great!

```ts
const error = new Error(errors?.map(e => e.message).join('\n') ?? 'unknown')
```

Notice the use of `Omit` there. Because the `fetchedAt` property is in our
`PokemonData`, but it's _not_ coming from the API, so saying that it is would be
lying to TypeScript and future readers of the code (which we should avoid).

## Monkey-patching with TypeScript

With that in place, we'll now get two new errors:

```ts
// add fetchedAt helper (used in the UI to help differentiate requests)
pokemon.fetchedAt = formatDate(new Date())
return pokemon
```

Adding new properties to an object like this is often referred to as
"monkey-patching."

The first is for the `pokemon.fetchedAt` and it says:

```
Property 'fetchedAt' does not exist on type 'Pick<PokemonData, "number" | "id" | "name" | "image" | "attacks">'. ts(2339)
```

The second is for the `return pokemon` and that says:

```
Property 'fetchedAt' is missing in type 'Pick<PokemonData, "number" | "id" | "name" | "image" | "attacks">' but required in type 'PokemonData'. ts(2741)
```

Well for crying out loud TypeScript, the first one is complaining that
`fetchedAt` shouldn't exist, and the second one is saying that it _should_! Make
up your mind! ðŸ˜©

We could always tell TypeScript to pipe down and use a type assertion to cast
`pokemon` as a full `PokemonData`. But I found an easier solution:

```ts
// add fetchedAt helper (used in the UI to help differentiate requests)
return Object.assign(pokemon, {fetchedAt: formatDate(new Date())})
```

This made both errors go away. `Object.assign` will combine object properties
onto the target object (the first parameter) and return that target object. This
made the compiler happy because it could detect that `pokemon` would go in
without `fetchedAt` and come out with `fetchedAt`.

In case you're curious, here's the type definition for `Object.assign`:

```ts
assign<T, U>(target: T, source: U): T & U;
```

And that's it! We've now successfully typed `fetch` for a particular request. ðŸŽ‰

## Typing the rejected value of the promise

One last learning here. Unfortunately, the `Promise` type generic only accepts
the `resolved` value and not the `rejected` value. So I can't do:

```ts
async function fetchPokemon(name: string): Promise<PokemonData, Error> {}
```

Turns out this is related to another frustration of mine:

```ts
try {
  throw new Error('oh no')
} catch (error: Error) {
  //            ^^^^^ Catch clause variable type annotation
  //                  must be 'any' or 'unknown' if specified.
  //                  ts(1196)
}
```

The reason for this is because an error can happen for completely unexpected
reasons. TypeScript thinks you can't possibly _know_ what triggered the error so
therefore you can't know what type the error will be.

This is a bit of a bummer, but it's understandable.

## Conclusion

Alrighty, so here's the final version:

```ts
const formatDate = (date: Date) =>
  `${date.getHours()}:${String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0')} ${String(
    date.getSeconds(),
  ).padStart(2, '0')}.${String(date.getMilliseconds()).padStart(3, '0')}`

type PokemonData = {
  id: string
  number: string
  name: string
  image: string
  fetchedAt: string
  attacks: {
    special: Array<{
      name: string
      type: string
      damage: number
    }>
  }
}

async function fetchPokemon(name: string): Promise<PokemonData> {
  const pokemonQuery = `
    query PokemonInfo($name: String) {
      pokemon(name: $name) {
        id
        number
        name
        image
        attacks {
          special {
            name
            type
            damage
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `

  const response = await window.fetch('https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/', {
    // learn more about this API here: https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: pokemonQuery,
      variables: {name: name.toLowerCase()},
    }),
  })

  type JSONResponse = {
    data?: {
      pokemon: Omit<PokemonData, 'fetchedAt'>
    }
    errors?: Array<{message: string}>
  }
  const {data, errors}: JSONResponse = await response.json()
  if (response.ok) {
    const pokemon = data?.pokemon
    if (pokemon) {
      // add fetchedAt helper (used in the UI to help differentiate requests)
      return Object.assign(pokemon, {fetchedAt: formatDate(new Date())})
    } else {
      return Promise.reject(new Error(`No pokemon with the name "${name}"`))
    }
  } else {
    // handle the graphql errors
    const error = new Error(errors?.map(e => e.message).join('\n') ?? 'unknown')
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
}
```

I hope that's interesting and useful to you! Good luck.
