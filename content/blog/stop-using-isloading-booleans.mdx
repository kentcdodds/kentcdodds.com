Let's play around with
[the Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
a bit and learn about the perils of `isLoading` booleans (and similar booleans
like: `isRejected`, `isIdle`, or `isResolved`) while we're at it. I'll be using
React to demonstrate this, but the concepts apply generally to any framework or
language.

```js
function geoPositionReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'error': {
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        error: action.error,
      }
    }
    case 'success': {
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        position: action.position,
      }
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
    }
  }
}

function useGeoPosition() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(geoPositionReducer, {
    isLoading: true,
    position: null,
    error: null,
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
      dispatch({
        type: 'error',
        error: new Error('Geolocation is not supported'),
      })
      return
    }
    const geoWatch = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
      position => dispatch({type: 'success', position}),
      error => dispatch({type: 'error', error}),
    )
    return () => navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(geoWatch)
  }, [])

  return state
}
```

This is pretty standard stuff for code like this. I've seen this in both
applications and open source libraries all over (React or not). However, there
are some problems with this approach. Can you think of what those might be? Let
me show you how a developer might use this particular hook:

```tsx
function YourPosition() {
  const {isLoading, position, error} = useGeoPosition()

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading your position...</div>
  }

  if (position) {
    return (
      <div>
        Lat: {position.coords.latitude}, Long: {position.coords.longitude}
      </div>
    )
  }

  if (error) {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Oh no, there was a problem getting your position:</div>
        <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Can you identify the problem yet? Yes? Awesome! No? No problem, let me help with
a little real-world scenario.

Imagine what would happen if the user were to hop into a car, started driving
around, and the device failed with a
`GeolocationPositionError.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` or
`GeolocationPositionError.TIMEOUT` or even if the user decided to disable the
geoposition permission for your app and you got a
`GeolocationPositionError.PERMISSION_DENIED`. What would happen then? With the
way the component above is written, we'd always show the last recorded position
and never show the user the error message!

If we swapped things around and only show the position if there's no error, then
we'd have the opposite problem: we'd only show an error, even if subsequent
requests for the position succeeded.

There are a few ways we could change this to avoid that problem:

1. Ensure users of the hook always show the position AND error if they're
   available.
2. Clear the `error` when getting the position is successful, and clear the
   `position` if there's an error.
3. Return an additional property indicating the current status of the
   geoposition information.

As a creator of something reusable, it's always easier to make it so people
_can't_ do the wrong thing even if they _want_ to. Or at least it's more natural
to do the right thing than the wrong thing (pit of success and all that). So
option #1 is out.

For option #2, there may be some people who want to show the most recent
position even if there was an error (and display the error message as well in
that case), so that won't work.

So let's go with option #3:

```js [6,13,17-22,31,44]
function geoPositionReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'error': {
      return {
        ...state,
        status: 'rejected',
        error: action.error,
      }
    }
    case 'success': {
      return {
        ...state,
        status: 'resolved',
        position: action.position,
      }
    }
    case 'started': {
      return {
        ...state,
        status: 'pending',
      }
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
    }
  }
}

function useGeoPosition() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(geoPositionReducer, {
    status: 'idle',
    position: null,
    error: null,
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
      dispatch({
        type: 'error',
        error: new Error('Geolocation is not supported'),
      })
      return
    }
    dispatch({type: 'started'})
    const geoWatch = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
      position => dispatch({type: 'success', position}),
      error => dispatch({type: 'error', error}),
    )
    return () => navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(geoWatch)
  }, [])

  return state
}
```

You'll notice that we added another dispatch so we could differentiate from
`idle` and `pending` states. In this particular case, there's not really a
difference between the two (before we just started with `isLoading` as true
which is effectively what this means), but there are cases where distinguishing
between these two finite states is important and I worry that if I don't include
them someone's going to copy/paste this and miss that important nuance.

Awesome, now users can use the `status` to render instead:

```tsx
function YourPosition() {
  const {status, position, error} = useGeoPosition()

  if (status === 'idle' || status === 'pending') {
    return <div>Loading your position...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'resolved') {
    return (
      <div>
        Lat: {position.coords.latitude}, Long: {position.coords.longitude}
      </div>
    )
  }

  if (status === 'rejected') {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Oh no, there was a problem getting your position:</div>
        <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      </div>
    )
  }

  // could also use a switch or nested ternary if that's your jam...
}
```

By using a `status` variable rather than a simple `isLoading` indicator we
enable our users to know exactly what the state is at any given point in time.

Now, if you'd like to ditch those `variable === 'string'` expressions in those
`if` statements because you like how terse a `isBoolean` is, have no fear,
that's simple enough:

```js
const {status, position, error} = useGeoPosition()
const isLoading = status === 'idle' || status === 'pending'
const isResolved = status === 'resolved'
const isRejected = status === 'rejected'
```

And one might argue that you could store those variables in your reducer's state
rather than [derive their values](/blog/dont-sync-state-derive-it). But that
leaves you vulnerable to
[impossible states](/blog/make-impossible-states-impossible)! But, if you really
want your users to not have to use the `variable === 'string'`, then just make
sure you stick with the `status` in your state to ensure you only have one
possible finite state value and then you can derive boolean states as a
convenience if you want to:

```js
function useGeoPosition() {
  // ... clipped out for brevity ...
  return {
    isLoading: status === 'idle' || status === 'pending',
    isIdle: status === 'idle',
    isPending: status === 'pending',
    isResolved: status === 'resolved',
    isRejected: status === 'rejected',
    ...state,
  }
}
```

## State machines

Everything is a state machine, and this one is particularly noticeable.
[XState](https://xstate.js.org) is an awesome library for representing state
machines in code, so I thought I'd show you what that could be like:

```js
import {createMachine, assign} from 'xstate'
import {useMachine} from '@xstate/react'

const context = {position: null, error: null}
const RESOLVE = {
  target: 'resolved',
  actions: 'setPosition',
}
const REJECT = {
  target: 'rejected',
  actions: 'setError',
}
const geoPositionMachine = createMachine(
  {
    id: 'geoposition',
    initial: 'idle',
    context,
    states: {
      idle: {
        on: {
          START: 'pending',
          REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED: 'rejectedNotSupported',
        },
      },
      pending: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      resolved: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      rejected: {
        on: {RESOLVE, REJECT},
      },
      rejectedNotSupported: {},
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      setPosition: assign({
        position: (context, event) => event.position,
      }),
      setError: assign({
        error: (context, event) => event.error,
      }),
    },
  },
)

function useGeoPosition() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(geoPositionMachine)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
      send('REJECT_NOT_SUPPORTED')
      return
    }
    send('START')
    const geoWatch = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
      position => send({type: 'RESOLVE', position}),
      error => send({type: 'REJECT', error}),
    )
    return () => navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(geoWatch)
  }, [send])

  return state
}
```

[Watch me build this in my livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrIeWzCUsnE&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgJCEkMlsqXea6OIF_uV_ub)

Firstly, if you're unfamiliar with state machines or xstate, be careful of
familiarity bias against this code. It may not be straightforward to you today,
but just like every abstraction, it becomes more straightforward the more time
you spend with it.

You'll notice several things about this example. I added a special state for
when geolocation is not supported. This state doesn't have any "event handlers"
attached to it and is therefore called a "terminal state." That makes sense for
our use case because if it's not supported then it's impossible to transition to
any other state and our state machine ensures that will never happen.

But more than this, I want you to notice that there is no longer a `status`
state we have to maintain. The `status` state is now just part of the machine's
finite state value. So the `status` is _built into_ the machine, rather than
managed separately.

Here's how we would use that (with as minimal changes as possible):

```tsx
function YourPosition() {
  const state = useGeoPosition()
  const {position, error} = state.context

  if (state.matches('rejectedNotSupported')) {
    return <div>This browser does not support Geolocation</div>
  }

  if (state.matches('idle') || state.matches('pending')) {
    return <div>Loading your position...</div>
  }

  if (state.matches('resolved')) {
    return (
      <div>
        Lat: {position.coords.latitude}, Long: {position.coords.longitude}
      </div>
    )
  }

  if (state.matches('rejected')) {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Oh no, there was a problem getting your position:</div>
        <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

And if we liked the previous API, we could preserve that API:

```js
function useGeoPosition() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(geoPositionMachine)
  // ... clipped out for brevity ...
  return {status: state.value, ...state.context}
}
```

You may personally find the reducer example simpler or more understandable than
the state machine. If you're unfamiliar with state machines or xstate then
that's understandable. I'm not going to get into the merits of state machines in
this post, but I have written about them a bit before:
[Implementing a simple state machine library in JavaScript](/blog/implementing-a-simple-state-machine-library-in-javascript).

Oh, and take a look at
[this implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/ancient-pond-y498q) from
[David Khourshid](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano) (author of xstate) in which
he completely removes the need for `useEffect` and instead puts the subscription
logic within the machine itself!!! This is cool because it means that our
machine is totally framework agnostic and can work regardless of which UI
framework you're using (or even if you've built your own). He even built in a
timeout (just for fun). Very cool stuff here.

## Conclusion

At the end of all of this, I hope that you appreciate the value of defining the
finite states that you have in your code and avoid bugs by doing so. This isn't
a pitch for finite state machines as much as it is a plea for reducing our
reliance on booleans that cannot represent all of the actual states our code can
be in at any given time. Use a state machine or an enum. Not a boolean. Thank
you, and good luck!
