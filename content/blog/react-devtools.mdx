This last week I had someone criticize using React component state because:

> there are no browser dev tools for inspecting component state

Maybe this person just forgot about
[the official React DevTools browser extension](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools),
maybe they didn't know about it. Whatever the case may be, it made me realize
that some people probably don't know about the browser extension, so I thought
I'd share it with you.

After considering it a bit, I decided that it would be easiest to share this
with you all via a quick (8 minute) video demo of the extension so here you have
it (the gif is a summary preview...)!

Note that this video is dated and the modern DevTools are EVEN BETTER. Learn

Good luck!
