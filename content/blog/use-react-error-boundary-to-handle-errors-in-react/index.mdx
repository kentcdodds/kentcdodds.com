import {
  TryCatchApp,
  BoundaryApp,
  RecoveryApp,
  Layout,
} from './components/index.jsx'

What's wrong with this code?

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function Greeting({subject}) {
  return <div>Hello {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function Farewell({subject}) {
  return <div>Goodbye {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
      <Farewell />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

If you send that to production, your users are going to get the white screen of
sadness:

![Chrome window with nothing but white](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033476/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/use-react-error-boundary-to-handle-errors-in-react/white-screen.png)

If you run this with create-react-app's error overlay (during development),
you'll get this:

![TypeError Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033477/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/use-react-error-boundary-to-handle-errors-in-react/error-overlay.png)

The problem is we need to either pass a `subject` prop (as a string) or default
the `subject` prop's value. Obviously, this is contrived, but runtime errors
happen all of the time and that's why it's a good idea to gracefully handle such
errors. So let's leave this error in for a moment and see what tools React has
for us to handle runtime errors like this.

## try/catch?

The naive approach to handling this kind of error would be to add a `try/catch`:

```tsx [4-11,14-18,22-26]
import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function ErrorFallback({error}) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre style={{color: 'red'}}>{error.message}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

function Greeting({subject}) {
  try {
    return <div>Hello {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
  } catch (error) {
    return <ErrorFallback error={error} />
  }
}

function Farewell({subject}) {
  try {
    return <div>Goodbye {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
  } catch (error) {
    return <ErrorFallback error={error} />
  }
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
      <Farewell />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

That "works":

<Layout>
  <TryCatchApp />
</Layout>

But, it may be ridiculous of me, but what if I don't want to wrap _every_
component in my app in a `try/catch` block? In regular JavaScript, you can
simply wrap the calling function in a `try/catch` and it'll catch any errors in
the functions it calls. Let's try that here:

```tsx [22-31]
import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function ErrorFallback({error}) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre style={{color: 'red'}}>{error.message}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

function Greeting({subject}) {
  return <div>Hello {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function Farewell({subject}) {
  return <div>Goodbye {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function App() {
  try {
    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting />
        <Farewell />
      </div>
    )
  } catch (error) {
    return <ErrorFallback error={error} />
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work. And that's because we're not the ones calling
`Greeting` and `Farewell`. React calls those functions. When we use them in JSX,
we're simply creating React elements with those functions as the `type`. Telling
React that "if the `App` is rendered, here are the other components that will
need to be called." But we're not actually calling them, so the `try/catch`
won't work.

I'm not too disappointed by this to be honest, because `try/catch` is inherently
imperative and I'd prefer a declarative way to handle errors in my app anyway.

## React Error Boundary

This is where the
[Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) feature comes
in to play. An "Error Boundary" is a special component that you write to handle
runtime errors like those above. For a component to be an Error Boundary:

1. It must be a class component 🙁
2. It must implement either `getDerivedStateFromError` or `componentDidCatch`.

Luckily, we have [`react-error-boundary`](https://npm.im/react-error-boundary)
which exposes the last Error Boundary component anyone needs to write because it
gives you all the tools you need to declaratively handle runtime errors in your
React apps.

So let's add [`react-error-boundary`](https://npm.im/react-error-boundary) and
render the `ErrorBoundary` component:

```tsx [25-28]
import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import {ErrorBoundary} from 'react-error-boundary'

function ErrorFallback({error}) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre style={{color: 'red'}}>{error.message}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

function Greeting({subject}) {
  return <div>Hello {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function Farewell({subject}) {
  return <div>Goodbye {subject.toUpperCase()}</div>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
        <Greeting />
        <Farewell />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

And that works perfectly:

<Layout>
  <BoundaryApp />
</Layout>

## Error Recovery

The nice thing about this is you can almost think about the `ErrorBoundary`
component the same way you do a `try/catch` block. You can wrap it around a
bunch of React components to handle lots of errors, or you can scope it down to
a specific part of the tree to have more granular error handling and recovery.
[`react-error-boundary`](https://npm.im/react-error-boundary) gives us all the
tools we need to manage this as well.

Here's a more complex example:

```tsx [6,36-40]
function ErrorFallback({error, resetErrorBoundary}) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre style={{color: 'red'}}>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  )
}

function Bomb({username}) {
  if (username === 'bomb') {
    throw new Error('💥 CABOOM 💥')
  }
  return `Hi ${username}`
}

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('')
  const usernameRef = React.useRef(null)

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        {`Username (don't type "bomb"): `}
        <input
          placeholder={`type "bomb"`}
          value={username}
          onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)}
          ref={usernameRef}
        />
      </label>
      <div>
        <ErrorBoundary
          FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
          onReset={() => {
            setUsername('')
            usernameRef.current.focus()
          }}
          resetKeys={[username]}
        >
          <Bomb username={username} />
        </ErrorBoundary>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here's what that experience is like:

<Layout>
  <RecoveryApp />
</Layout>

You'll notice that if you type "bomb", the `Bomb` component is replaced by the
`ErrorFallback` component and you can recover by either changing the `username`
(because that's in the `resetKeys` prop) or by clicking "Try again" because
that's wired up to `resetErrorBoundary` and we have an `onReset` that resets our
state to a username that won't trigger the error all over again.

## Handle all errors

Unfortunately, there are some errors that React doesn't/can't hand off to our
Error Boundary. To quote
[the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries):

> Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
>
> - Event handlers
>   ([learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#how-about-event-handlers))
> - Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
> - Server side rendering
> - Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

Most of the time, folks will manage some `error` state and render something
different in the event of an error, like so:

```tsx
function Greeting() {
  const [{status, greeting, error}, setState] = React.useState({
    status: 'idle',
    greeting: null,
    error: null,
  })

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value
    setState({status: 'pending'})
    fetchGreeting(name).then(
      newGreeting => setState({greeting: newGreeting, status: 'resolved'}),
      newError => setState({error: newError, status: 'rejected'}),
    )
  }

  return status === 'rejected' ? (
    <ErrorFallback error={error} />
  ) : status === 'resolved' ? (
    <div>{greeting}</div>
  ) : (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input id="name" />
      <button type="submit" onClick={handleClick}>
        get a greeting
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Unfortunately, doing things that way means that you have to maintain TWO ways to
handle errors:

1. Runtime errors
2. `fetchGreeting` errors

Luckily, [`react-error-boundary`](https://npm.im/react-error-boundary) also
exposes a simple hook to help with these situations as well. Here's how you
could use that to side-step this entirely:

```tsx [6,14]
function Greeting() {
  const [{status, greeting}, setState] = React.useState({
    status: 'idle',
    greeting: null,
  })
  const handleError = useErrorHandler()

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value
    setState({status: 'pending'})
    fetchGreeting(name).then(
      newGreeting => setState({greeting: newGreeting, status: 'resolved'}),
      error => handleError(error),
    )
  }

  return status === 'resolved' ? (
    <div>{greeting}</div>
  ) : (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input id="name" />
      <button type="submit" onClick={handleClick}>
        get a greeting
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

So when our `fetchGreeting` promise is rejected, the `handleError` function is
called with the error and react-error-boundary will make that propagate to the
nearest error boundary like usual.

Alternatively, let's say you're using a hook that gives you the error:

```tsx
function Greeting() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('')
  const {status, greeting, error} = useGreeting(name)
  useErrorHandler(error)

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value
    setName(name)
  }

  return status === 'resolved' ? (
    <div>{greeting}</div>
  ) : (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input id="name" />
      <button type="submit" onClick={handleClick}>
        get a greeting
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In this case, if the `error` is ever set to a truthy value, then it will be
propagated to the nearest error boundary.

In either case, you could handle those errors like this:

```tsx
const ui = (
  <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
    <Greeting />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

And now that'll handle your runtime errors as well as the async errors in the
`fetchGreeting` or `useGreeting` code.

  Note: you might be interested to know that [the
  implementation](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary/blob/3c9339753b7f2982255a786af06077b7d4999a7a/src/index.js#L71-L76)
  of `useErrorHandler` is only 6 lines long 😉
</callout-info>

## Conclusion

Error Boundaries have been a feature in React for years and we're still in this
awkward situation of handling runtime errors with Error Boundaries and handling
other error states within our components when we would be much better off
reusing our Error Boundary components for both. If you haven't already given
[`react-error-boundary`](https://npm.im/react-error-boundary) a try, definitely
give it a solid look!

Good luck.

Oh, one other thing. Right now, you may notice that you'll experience that error
overlay even if the error was handled by your Error Boundary. This will only
happen during development (if you're using a dev server that supports it, like
react-scripts, gatsby, or codesandbox). It won't show up in production. Yes, I
agree this is annoying.
[PRs welcome](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6530).
