What's wrong with this code?

```tsx
function ContactList({contacts}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {contacts.length &&
          contacts.map(contact => (
            <li key={contact.id}>
              {contact.firstName} {contact.lastName}
            </li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Not sure? Let me ask you another question. What would happen with the above code
if `contacts` was `[]`? That's right! You'd render `0`!

I shipped this mistake to production at PayPal once. No joke. It was on
[this page](https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/transfer/homepage):

![PayPal page with contacts](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033483/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/use-ternaries-rather-than-and-and-in-jsx/contacts.png)

When a user came with no contacts, this is what they saw:

![PayPal page with 0 instead of contacts](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033483/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/use-ternaries-rather-than-and-and-in-jsx/no-contacts.png)

Yeah, that was not fun... Why is that? Because when JavaScript evaluates
`0 && anything` the result will _always_ be `0` because `0` is falsy, so it
doesn't evaluate the right side of the `&&`.

The solution? Use a ternary to be explicit about what you want rendered in the
falsy case. In our case, it was nothing (so using `null` is perfect):

```tsx
function ContactList({contacts}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {contacts.length
          ? contacts.map(contact => (
              <li key={contact.id}>
                {contact.firstName} {contact.lastName}
              </li>
            ))
          : null}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

What about this code? What's wrong here?

```tsx
function Error({error}) {
  return error && <div className="fancy-error">{error.message}</div>
}
```

Not sure? What if `error` is `undefined`? If that's the case, you'll get the
following error:

```
Uncaught Error: Error(...): Nothing was returned from render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing, return null.
```

Or, in production, you might get this:

```
react-dom.production.min.js:13 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Minified React error #152; visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=152&args[]=f for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.
```

The problem here is that `undefined && anything` will always evaluate to
`undefined`.

## So what gives?

Really, the problem in both of these cases is we're using `&&` to do conditional
rendering. Said differently, we're using `&&` to do conditional argument
passing. Remember,
[JSX is a simple syntactic abstraction over calling `React.createElement`](/blog/what-is-jsx).
So it'd be like trying to write this:

```js
function throwTheCandy(candyNames) {
  for (const candyName of candyNames) {
    throwCandy(candyName)
  }
}

throwTheCandy(candies.length && candies.map(c => c.name))
```

That wouldn't make any sense right? We've got our types all messed up. The
reason React allows you to do this though is because rendering `0` is valid.

Luckily, TypeScript can help you avoid the second example of accidentally
returning `undefined`. But on top of that layer of protection, how about we be
more explicit about our intentions. If you want to do something _conditionally_,
don't abuse the logical AND operator (`&&`).

It actually seems counter-intuitive because we often use `&&` in an `if`
condition to say: if both of these values are truthy, then do this thing,
otherwise don't. Unfortunately for our use-case, the `&&` operator also has this
"feature" where if both values aren't truthy, it returns the value of the falsy
one:

```js
0 && true // 0
true && 0 // 0
false && true // false
true && '' // ''
```

## Use actual branching syntax

So I strongly suggest that rather than abusing `&&` (or `||` for that matter) in
your JSX, you use _actual_ branching syntax features, like ternaries
(`condition ? trueConsequent : falseConsequent`) or even `if` statements (and in
the future, maybe even
[do expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions)).

I'm personally a fan of ternaries, but if you'd prefer `if` statements, that's
cool too. Here's how I'd do the contacts thing with `if` statements:

```tsx
function ContactList({contacts}) {
  let contactsElements = null
  if (contacts.length) {
    contactsElements = contacts.map(contact => (
      <li key={contact.id}>
        {contact.firstName} {contact.lastName}
      </li>
    ))
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>{contactsElements}</ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Personally, I think the ternary is more readable (if you disagree, remember that
"readable" is subjective and the readability of something has much more to do
with familiarity than anything else). Whatever you do, you do you, just don't do
bugs.

Another benefit of using actual branching syntax is that test coverage tools can
detect and indicate when your tests are not covering one of the branches.

## Conclusion

I'm well aware that we could've solved the contact problem by using
`!!contacts.length && ...` or `contacts.length > 0 && ...` or even
`Boolean(contacts.length) && ...`, but I still prefer not abusing the logical
AND operator for rendering. I prefer being explicit by using a ternary.

To finish strong, if I had to write both of these components today, here's how
I'd write them:

```tsx
function ContactList({contacts}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {contacts.length
          ? contacts.map(contact => (
              <li key={contact.id}>
                {contact.firstName} {contact.lastName}
              </li>
            ))
          : null}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
function Error({error}) {
  return error ? <div className="fancy-error">{error.message}</div> : null
}
```

Good luck!
