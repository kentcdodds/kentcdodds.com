When you want to display a list of items to a user, I'm afraid `.join(', ')`
just won't cut it:

```js
console.log(['apple'].join(', ')) // apple
// looks good
console.log(['apple', 'grape'].join(', ')) // apple, grape
// nah, I want "apple and grape"
console.log(['apple', 'grape', 'pear'].join(', ')) // apple, grape, pear
// wut?
```

Ok, so bust out your string concat skills right? That's what I did... but
holdup, there's a better way:

Have you heard of
[`Intl.ListFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat)?
Well, it's likely that this can do all you need and more. Let's take a look:

```ts
const items = [
  'Sojourner',
  'Opportunity',
  'Spirit',
  'Curiosity',
  'Perseverance',
]

const formatter = new Intl.ListFormat('en', {
  style: 'long',
  type: 'conjunction',
})
console.log(formatter.format(items))
// logs: "Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance"
```

The cool thing about this is that because it's coming from the `Intl` standard,
a TON of locales are supported, so you can get internationalization for "free".

The first argument to the ListFormat constructor is the locale (we're using
`'en'` above for "English"). The second argument is the options of `style` and
`type`. The `style` option can be one of `'long'`,` 'short'`, or `'narrow'`. The
`type` can be one of `'conjunction'`, `'disjunction'`, or `'unit'`.

With the list above, here's all the combination of those (with `en` as the
locale):

|                   | **`long`**                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`conjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance |
| **`disjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, or Perseverance  |
| **`unit`**        | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, Perseverance     |

|                   | **`short`**                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`conjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, & Perseverance  |
| **`disjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, or Perseverance |
| **`unit`**        | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, Perseverance    |

|                   | **`narrow`**                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`conjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, Perseverance    |
| **`disjunction`** | Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, or Perseverance |
| **`unit`**        | Sojourner Opportunity Spirit Curiosity Perseverance        |

Interestingly, if we play around with the locale, things behave unexpectedly:

```js
new Intl.ListFormat('en', {style: 'narrow', type: 'unit'}).format(items)
// Sojourner Opportunity Spirit Curiosity Perseverance

new Intl.ListFormat('es', {style: 'narrow', type: 'unit'}).format(items)
// Sojourner Opportunity Spirit Curiosity Perseverance

new Intl.ListFormat('de', {style: 'narrow', type: 'unit'}).format(items)
// Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity und Perseverance
```

Perhaps German speakers can clear up for us why the combo of `narrow` and `unit`
for `de` behaves more like `long` and `conjunction` because I have no idea.

There's also a lesser-known `localeMatcher` option which can be configured to
either `'lookup'` or `'best fit'` (defaults to `'best fit'`). As far as I can
tell from
[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locale_negotiation),
its purpose is to tell the browser how to determine which locale to use based on
the one given in the constructor. In my own testing I was unable to determine a
difference in functionality switching between these options 🤷‍♂️

Frankly, I think it's typically better to trust the browser on stuff like this
rather than write what the browser offers. This is because the longer I spend
time writing software, the more I find that things are rarely as simple as we
think they'll be (especially when it comes to internationalization). But there
are definitely times where the platform comes up short and you can't quite do
what you're looking to do. That's when it makes sense to do it yourself.

So I put together a little function that suited my use case pretty well, and I
want to share it with you. Before I do, I want to be clear that I _did_ try this
without reduce (using a for loop) and I think the reduce method was considerably
simpler. Feel free to take a whack at the for loop version though if you want.

```js
function listify(
  array,
  {conjunction = 'and ', stringify = item => item.toString()} = {},
) {
  return array.reduce((list, item, index) => {
    if (index === 0) return stringify(item)
    if (index === array.length - 1) {
      if (index === 1) return `${list} ${conjunction}${stringify(item)}`
      else return `${list}, ${conjunction}${stringify(item)}`
    }
    return `${list}, ${stringify(item)}`
  }, '')
}
```

In my codebase, is used like so:

```js
const to = `To: ${listify(mentionedMembersNicknames)}`
// and
const didYouMean = `Did you mean ${listify(closeMatches, {
  conjunction: 'or ',
})}?`
```

I'd take the time to walk through this code with you, but actually **as I was
writing this post,** I realized that my use case wasn't as special as I thought
it was and I tried rewriting this to use `Intl.ListFormat` and wouldn't you know
it, with a small change to the API, I was able to make a simpler implementation
on top of the standard:

```js
function listify(
  array,
  {
    type = 'conjunction',
    style = 'long',
    stringify = item => item.toString(),
  } = {},
) {
  const stringified = array.map(item => stringify(item))
  const formatter = new Intl.ListFormat('en', {style, type})
  return formatter.format(stringified)
}
```

With that, now I do this:

```js
// no change for the default case
const to = `To: ${listify(mentionedMembersNicknames)}`
// switch to using the "type" option rather than overloading/abusing the term "conjunction"
const didYouMean = `Did you mean ${listify(closeMatches, {
  type: 'disjunction',
})}?`
```

## Conclusion

So it just goes to show you that you _might_ be doing some extra work that you
might not need to be doing. The platform probably does this for you
automatically! Oh, and just for fun, here's a TypeScript version of that
finished code (I'm in the process of migrating this project to TypeScript).

```ts
// unfortunately TypeScript doesn't have Intl.ListFormat yet 😢
// so we'll just add it ourselves:
type ListFormatOptions = {
  type?: 'conjunction' | 'disjunction' | 'unit'
  style?: 'long' | 'short' | 'narrow'
  localeMatcher?: 'lookup' | 'best fit'
}
declare namespace Intl {
  class ListFormat {
    constructor(locale: string, options: ListFormatOptions)
    public format: (items: Array<string>) => string
  }
}

type ListifyOptions<ItemType> = {
  type?: ListFormatOptions['type']
  style?: ListFormatOptions['style']
  stringify?: (item: ItemType) => string
}
function listify<ItemType>(
  array: Array<ItemType>,
  {
    type = 'conjunction',
    style = 'long',
    stringify = (thing: {toString(): string}) => thing.toString(),
  }: ListifyOptions<ItemType> = {},
) {
  const stringified = array.map(item => stringify(item))
  const formatter = new Intl.ListFormat('en', {style, type})
  return formatter.format(stringified)
}
```

And now we get sweet autocomplete for those options and type checking on that
stringify method. Nice!

Oh, by the way, you'll always want to double-check browser support for whatever
you're using. There's [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=listformat) and
[the MDN article on Intl.ListFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat)
also has
[a chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat#browser_compatibility).

I hope that was interesting and useful to you!
