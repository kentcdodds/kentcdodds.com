Last weekend, my daughter and I flew to Boston for one of the most
meaningful experiences of my life: witnessing the baptism of our friends
Jeremiah and Beiyi Dow.

## How We Met

It started at family camp in August 2025. I had invited all of you to
join us at Aspen Grove for the same week, hoping to connect with people who
shared similar interests.

I had a handful of people submit the form, but only heard from one family that
they were actually coming. However, on the second day of camp, I got a message
from someone I'd never met. Jeremiah Dow. He explained that a work emergency had
kept him home, but his wife Beiyi and their twin six-year-old daughters were
there, feeling a bit out of place.

We found them and quickly became friends. My wife Brooke and I spent the week
doing activities with Beiyi while the girls went to their groups. My daughter,
as usual, became fast friends with everyone. When camp ended, we even spent an
extra day together exploring museums before they headed home.

What struck us most was how naturally we connected. Jeremiah later told me that
the way we welcomed his family showed a kind of love and generosity they weren't
used to. I didn't think much of it at the time. We were just being ourselves.

## A Conversation at Remix Jam

I knew I'd see them again in October at [Remix Jam](https://remix.run/jam/2025),
where [I was speaking](/talks/interactive-mcp-with-react-router).

This is us having a conversation at Remix Jam:

When we reconnected, our conversation turned to faith. I'm a member of
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org),
and [I always travel with a couple copies](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Akentcdodds%20%22book%20of%20mormon%22&src=typed_query) of
[the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe/book-of-mormon)
with [my handwritten testimony](/testimony) to give to anyone interested.

They asked questions. I shared what I could. They accepted a copy of the book,
and I helped them find a local congregation near their home in New Hampshire.

## Finding Community

What happened next unfolded beautifully over the following weeks. They started
attending church and found it welcoming. They made friends quickly, especially
with a family who happened to have twin girls the same age as their daughters
and another family who had a daughter the same age as well. The missionaries met
with them and taught them about the church and answered their questions.

One thing Bei shared with me really stuck: she said she was attracted to "the
fruit of God's work" (meaning the people she met and the way they lived). She
appreciated that the church invited her to seek answers for herself rather than
forcing anything on her.

By early December, they had both decided to be baptized together on January 4th.

## The Baptism

When they started attending church, my family and I talked about how awesome it
would be if they joined the church and my wife and I decided I would try to make
it out to their baptism if I could. So when they told use they were getting
baptized, I didn't hesitate. They asked me to speak at the service and to my
great honor, Bei and Jeremiah both asked if I would baptize them and confer the
gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. I was humbled and thrilled to accept.

The day itself was beautiful. Most of the ward stayed after regular Sunday
services to attend, filling the room with over fifty people. Jeremiah even
shared his testimony at the church meeting, expressing how the community had
shown him the "good fruit" he was looking for.

I gave a talk about what baptism means. Not just a symbol, but an entrance into
a covenant with Christ and the start of their journey to drawing closer to
Christ and each other.

Then we performed the baptism. Being a part of Jeremiah and Bei making that
commitment was deeply moving. Afterward, Bei said she felt warm, happy, and full
inside.

During the confirmations, I felt the kind of spiritual power that's hard to
describe. I told them both that God loved them and was proud of them, that they'd
been prepared for this, and that they would never be alone.

## Reflection

I don't think I had any right to be so involved in something so sacred. I had
only met them a few months earlier. But sometimes that's how it works. Small
acts of kindness create connections that lead somewhere unexpected. Along with
intentionally sharing my faith and welcoming people to ask genuine questions.

Of course, the Dow's were so prepared for this. They had been searching for this
for a long time. And the members of the ward there were so welcoming and kind.

My daughter and I flew home that evening, grateful beyond words. This was one of
those experiences that reminds you why we're here and what really matters.

P.S. Hit me up if you'd like to know more about the church. Also, there's no
pressure for you to join the church if you accept a copy of the Book of Mormon
from me! I give it to anyone who asks for one and hope it helps bring you closer
to Christ.
