I got a great question from [Taranveer Bains](https://github.com/tearingItUp786)
[on my AMA](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ama/issues/763) asking:

> I ran into an issue where if I provided a function that used hooks in its
> implementation and returned some JSX to the callback for
> `Array.prototype.map`. The error I received was
> `React Error: Rendered fewer hooks than expected`.

Here's a simple reproduction of that error

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([])
  const addItem = () => setItems(i => [...i, {id: i.length}])
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
      <div>{items.map(Counter)}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here's how that behaves when rendered (with an error boundary around it so
we don't crash this page):

<Comps.Rendered>
  <Comps.BadApp />
</Comps.Rendered>

In the console, there are more details in a message like this:

```
Warning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks
called by BadCounterList. This will lead to bugs and
errors if not fixed. For more information, read the
Rules of Hooks: https://fb.me/rules-of-hooks

   Previous render            Next render
   ------------------------------------------------------
1. useState                   useState
2. undefined                  useState
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

So what's going on here? Let's dig in.

First off, I'll just tell you the solution:

```tsx remove=1 add=2
<div>{items.map(Counter)}</div>
<div>{items.map(i => <Counter key={i.id} />)}</div>
```

<callout-warning class="aside">
  Before you start thinking it has to do with the `key` prop, let me just tell
  you it doesn't. But the key prop is important in general and you can learn
  about that from my other blog post: [Understanding React's key
  prop](/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop)
</callout-warning>

Here's another way to make this same kind of error happen:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  let otherState
  if (count > 0) {
    React.useEffect(() => {
      console.log('count', count)
    })
  }
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

The point is that our `Example` component is calling a hook conditionally, this
goes against the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) and
is the reason the
[eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)
package has a `rules-of-hooks` rule. You can read more about this limitation
[from the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation),
but suffice it to say, you need to make sure that the hooks are always called
the same number of times for a given component.

Ok, but in our first example, we aren't calling hooks conditionally right? So
why is this causing a problem for us in this case?

Well, let's rewrite our original example slightly:

```tsx [14-16]
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([])
  const addItem = () => setItems(i => [...i, {id: i.length}])
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
      <div>
        {items.map(() => {
          return Counter()
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And you'll notice that we're making a function that's just calling another
function so let's inline that:

```tsx [8-12]
function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([])
  const addItem = () => setItems(i => [...i, {id: i.length}])
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
      <div>
        {items.map(() => {
          const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
          const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
          return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Starting to look problematic? You'll notice that we haven't actually changed any
behavior. This is just a refactor. But do you notice the problem now? Let me
repeat what I said earlier: you need to make sure that the hooks are always
called the same number of times **for a given component.**

Based on our refactor, we've come to realize that the "given component" for all
our `useState` calls is not the `App` and `Counter`, but the `App` alone. This
is due to the way we're calling our `Counter` function component. It's not a
component at all, but a function. React doesn't know the difference between us
calling a function in our JSX and inlining it. So it cannot associate anything
to the `Counter` function, because it's not being rendered like a component.

This is why you need to use JSX ([or `React.createElement`](/blog/what-is-jsx))
when rendering components rather than simply calling the function. That way, any
hooks that are used can be registered with the instance of the component that
React creates.

**So don't call function components. Render them.**

Oh, and it's notable to mention that _sometimes_ it will "work" to call function
components. Like so:

```tsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Here is a counter:</div>
      {Counter()}
    </div>
  )
}
```

But the hooks that are in `Counter` will be associated with the `App` component
instance, because there is no `Counter` component instance. So it will "work,"
but not the way you'd expect and it could behave in unexpected ways as you make
changes. So just render it normally.

Good luck!
