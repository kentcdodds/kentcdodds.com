Here's the secret: More Problems, More Experience

Here's one thing that I've observed in my time as a career software engineer:
**There's no shortcut to experience.** You have to put in the time. That said,
there are things that you can do to ensure that your time is contributing
effectively to your well of experience and that's what we're going to talk about
here.

## Where does experience come from?

Some people seem to think that you can only get experience incrementally over
time. That it's just something mysterious that comes to you over the course of
working at Company X for Y number of years. These same people mistakenly turn
down talented engineers because they lack "experience." But as much as time and
experience are correlated, time does _not_ tell you how experienced an engineer
is, nor how well they will perform in a specific engineering role.

"Technical Experience" comes from _experiencing_ different situations and then
learning from those experiences to improve your own response to the same or
similar situations in the future. Another way to say "situations" is "problems."
Engineers who make the most of their "experience time investment" are the ones
who intentionally expose themselves to **various** software related problems and
then work hard to overcome or find/build solutions to those problems.

So when you're looking to increase your own level of technical experience (and
increase the return on your time investment), look for "problems."

## Where can you find problems?

It depends on the kind of experience you're looking for, but I can tell you a
few places I've found the problems that have given me the experience I have had:
Work and Open Source. There is a never-ending, ever-growing list of software
problems at most companies (certainly any company I would want to work for), and
the open source community is facing software problems that you can pitch in and
find solutions to.

And I'm not talking about: "Hey, I'm having trouble triaging my GitHub issues,
could you build me an app to solve that problem?" While this is a great kind of
problem to solve, and would definitely give you experience, I'm talking about
lower-level kinds of problems. Like: "There's some bug in this library" or "this
test is flakey" or "when we deploy our app, we get a spike of 500 errors." These
kinds of problems are all over the place and require some deep digging into the
code to figure out what's going on.

Another thing you can do is be the go-to person for problems of a certain domain
that you want to improve on. You want to be the "accessibility expert" at your
organization? Do some research, and give a talk internally at your company.
Invite people to ping you with questions. The more questions you get about the
topic, the more varied problems you'll be exposed to, and the more digging
you'll have to do. It's a cycle.

This is kinda what happened to me with testing. I actually never intended on
being "the testing guy," but I developed a few experience-based opinions,
started talking about it. It wasn't long before I didn't have to look for
problems, they just came to me in the form of questions. People brought their
problems to me which made me even more experienced, and with that experience, I
was able to build [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com) which
encompasses all of the knowledge that I've gained over the years of experiencing
problems–my own and other people's.

## How do you use problems to gain experience?

One of the first libraries that I worked on was
[angular-formly](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly) and I got into it
because there was a feature that didn't exist that I needed. I could have
passively moved on to another library to retrofit its capabilities to my app (or
vice versa 😬). Instead I looked through the code to see that what I wanted was
possible,
[then opened an issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/16),
followed by
[a pull request](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/17). A few
months and PRs later, and I found myself a core maintainer, and then later the
sole maintainer of the project. That whole project presented a TON of
"experience-building problems" for me (as well as
[opportunities to speak internationally](/talks/#json-powered-forms)). I learned
a TON about how forms work on the web and as a maintainer of the project.

When you find a problem. DIG. If you have problems digging, then awesome! You
found another problem to solve! You can work to solve _those_ problems. The
whole process will give you more experience. Read
["Spelunking in node_modules 👷"](/blog/spelunking-in-node-modules) for more
thoughts on this kind of process.

Another thing: document your findings. You'll learn and remember more by writing
down the things that you learned. It's even better if you present your learnings
in a form intended for public consumption (blog post, youtube video, etc). This
will require you to dig even further to confirm (or debunk) your assumptions,
giving you more experience.

## Conclusion

To sum this up, **you develop more experience as you bump against and solve
varied problems.** Your brain is a muscle and it gets better at solving similar
problems the more it's exercised in a certain way.

I hope this helps you develop into the experienced engineer you'd like to be.
Good luck!
