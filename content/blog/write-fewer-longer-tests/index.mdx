Imagine we have this UI that renders a loading spinner until some data is
loaded:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import * as api from './api'

function Course({courseId}) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({
    loading: false,
    course: null,
    error: null,
  })

  const {loading, course, error} = state

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setState({loading: true, course: null, error: null})
    api.getCourseInfo(courseId).then(
      data => setState({loading: false, course: data, error: null}),
      e => setState({loading: false, course: null, error: e}),
    )
  }, [courseId])

  return (
    <>
      <div role="alert" aria-live="polite">
        {loading ? 'Loading...' : error ? error.message : null}
      </div>
      {course ? <CourseInfo course={course} /> : null}
    </>
  )
}

function CourseInfo({course}) {
  const {title, subtitle, topics} = course
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <strong>{subtitle}</strong>
      <ul>
        {topics.map(t => (
          <li key={t}>{t}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Course
```

Here's what that would render (I added a "Re-mount" button so you can try making
it re-load. I also made it fail 50% of the time):

import {Example} from './components'

<Example />

Let's talk about testing this component. I'm going to mock out the
`api.getCourseInfo(courseId)` call so we don't actually make any network
requests for this test. So here are some of the things we'll need to assert that
this component does:

1. it should show a loading spinner
2. it should call the getCourseInfo function properly
3. it should render the title
4. it should render the subtitle
5. it should render the list of topics

Then there's the error case (like if the request fails):

1. it should show a loading spinner
2. it should call the getCourseInfo function properly
3. it should render the error message

Many people read that list of requirements for a component and turn those into
individual test cases. Maybe you've read about a so-called "only one assertion
per test best practice." Let's give that a try:

```tsx
// 🛑 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO...
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, wait, cleanup} from '@testing-library/react/pure'
import {getCourseInfo} from '../api'
import Course from '../course'

jest.mock('../api')

function buildCourse(overrides) {
  return {
    title: 'TEST_COURSE_TITLE',
    subtitle: 'TEST_COURSE_SUBTITLE',
    topics: ['TEST_COURSE_TOPIC'],
    ...overrides,
  }
}

describe('Course success', () => {
  const courseId = '123'
  const title = 'My Awesome Course'
  const subtitle = 'Learn super cool things'
  const topics = ['topic 1', 'topic 2']

  let utils
  beforeAll(() => {
    getCourseInfo.mockResolvedValueOnce(buildCourse({title, subtitle, topics}))
  })

  afterAll(() => {
    cleanup()
    jest.resetAllMocks()
  })

  it('should show a loading spinner', () => {
    utils = render(<Course courseId={courseId} />)
    expect(utils.getByRole('alert')).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)
  })

  it('should call the getCourseInfo function properly', () => {
    expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledWith(courseId)
  })

  it('should render the title', async () => {
    expect(await utils.findByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent(title)
  })

  it('should render the subtitle', () => {
    expect(utils.getByText(subtitle)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should render the list of topics', () => {
    const topicElsText = utils
      .getAllByRole('listitem')
      .map(el => el.textContent)
    expect(topicElsText).toEqual(topics)
  })
})

describe('Course failure', () => {
  const courseId = '321'
  const message = 'TEST_ERROR_MESSAGE'

  let utils, alert
  beforeAll(() => {
    getCourseInfo.mockRejectedValueOnce({message})
  })

  afterAll(() => {
    cleanup()
    jest.resetAllMocks()
  })

  it('should show a loading spinner', () => {
    utils = render(<Course courseId={courseId} />)
    alert = utils.getByRole('alert')
    expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)
  })

  it('should call the getCourseInfo function properly', () => {
    expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledWith(courseId)
  })

  it('should render the error message', async () => {
    await wait(() => expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(message))
  })
})
```

I definitely recommend against this approach to testing. There are a few
problems with it:

1. The tests are not at all isolated (read
   [Test Isolation with React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/test-isolation-with-react))
2. Mutable variables are shared between tests (read
   [Avoid Nesting when you're Testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing))
3. Asynchronous things can happen between tests resulting in you getting `act`
   warnings (for this particular example)

<callout-info>
  It's notable that the first two points there are applicable regardless of what
  you're testing. The third is a bit of an implementation detail between jest
  and `act`.
</callout-info>

Instead, I suggest that we combine the tests like so:

```tsx
// ✅ This is an example of what to do
import {render, screen, wait} from '@testing-library/react'
import * as React from 'react'

import {getCourseInfo} from '../api'
import Course from '../course'

jest.mock('../api')

afterEach(() => {
  jest.resetAllMocks()
})

function buildCourse(overrides) {
  return {
    title: 'TEST_COURSE_TITLE',
    subtitle: 'TEST_COURSE_SUBTITLE',
    topics: ['TEST_COURSE_TOPIC'],
    ...overrides,
  }
}

test('course loads and renders the course information', async () => {
  const courseId = '123'
  const title = 'My Awesome Course'
  const subtitle = 'Learn super cool things'
  const topics = ['topic 1', 'topic 2']

  getCourseInfo.mockResolvedValueOnce(buildCourse({title, subtitle, topics}))

  render(<Course courseId={courseId} />)

  expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledWith(courseId)
  expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)

  const alert = screen.getByRole('alert')
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)

  const titleEl = await screen.findByRole('heading')
  expect(titleEl).toHaveTextContent(title)

  expect(screen.getByText(subtitle)).toBeInTheDocument()

  const topicElsText = screen.getAllByRole('listitem').map(el => el.textContent)
  expect(topicElsText).toEqual(topics)
})

test('an error is rendered if there is a problem getting course info', async () => {
  const message = 'TEST_ERROR_MESSAGE'
  const courseId = '321'

  getCourseInfo.mockRejectedValueOnce({message})

  render(<Course courseId={courseId} />)

  expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledWith(courseId)
  expect(getCourseInfo).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)

  const alert = screen.getByRole('alert')
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)

  await wait(() => expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(message))
})
```

Now our tests are completely isolated, there are no longer shared mutable
variable references, there's less nesting so following the tests is easier, and
we will no longer get the `act` warning from React.

Yes, we've violated that "one assertion per test" rule, but that rule was
originally created because testing frameworks did a poor job of giving you the
contextual information you needed to determine what was causing your test
failures. Now a test failure for these Jest tests will look something like this:

```
 FAIL  src/__tests__/course-better.js
  ● course loads and renders the course information

    Unable to find an element with the text: Learn super cool things. This could be because the text is broken up by multiple elements. In this case, you can provide a function for your text matcher to make your matcher more flexible.

    <body>
      <div>
        <div
          aria-live="polite"
          role="alert"
        />
        <div>
          <h1>
            My Awesome Course
          </h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              topic 1
            </li>
            <li>
              topic 2
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>

      41 |
    > 42 |   expect(getByText(subtitle)).toBeInTheDocument()

      45 |   expect(topicElsText).toEqual(topics)

And in your terminal that'll all be syntax highlighted as well:

Thanks to our amazing tools, identifying which assertion resulted in the failure
is trivial. I didn't even tell you what I broke, but I'll bet you'd know where
to look if this happened to you! And you can avoid the issues described above.
If you'd like to make things even more clear, you can add a code comment above
the assertion to explain what is important about the assertion you're making.

## Conclusion

Don't worry about having long tests. When you're thinking about your two users
and [avoid the test user](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user), then
your tests will often involve multiple assertions and that's a good thing. Don't
arbitrarily separate your assertions into individual test blocks, there's no
good reason to do so.

I should note that I wouldn't recommend rendering the same component multiple
times in a single test block (re-renders are ok if you're testing what happens
on prop updates for example).

**The principle:**

<callout-success class="important">
  Think of a test case workflow for a manual tester and try to make each of your
  test cases include all parts to that workflow. This often results in multiple
  actions and assertions which is fine.
</callout-success>

There's the old "Arrange" "Act" "Assert" model for structuring tests. I
typically suggest that you have a single "Arrange" per test, and as many "Act"
and "Asserts" as necessary for the workflow you're trying to get confidence
about.

## Appendix

### I'm still getting the `act` warning, even though I'm using React Testing Library's utilities!

React's `act` utility is built-into React Testing Library. There are very few
times you should have to use it directly if you're using
[React Testing Library's async utilities](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet#async):

1. When using `jest.useFakeTimers()`
2. When using `useImperativeHandle` and calling functions directly that call
   state updaters.
3. When testing custom hooks and calling functions directly that call state
   updaters.

Any other time, you should be covered by React Testing Library. If you're still
experiencing the `act` warning, then the most likely reason is something is
happening **after your test completes** for which you should be waiting.

Here's an example of a test (using the same example as above) suffering from
this problem:

```tsx
// 🛑 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO...
test('course shows loading screen', () => {
  getCourseInfo.mockResolvedValueOnce(buildCourse())
  render(<Course courseId="123" />)
  const alert = screen.getByRole('alert')
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)
})
```

Here we're rendering the `Course` and just trying to verify that the loading
message shows up properly. The problem is when we `render` the `<Course />`
component, it immediately fires an async request. We're correctly mocking that
out (which we have to do, otherwise our test will actually make the request).
However, our test completes synchronously before the mocked out request has a
chance to resolve. When it finally does, our success handler is called which
calls the state updater function and we get the `act` warning.

There are three ways to fix this.

1. Wait for the promise to resolve
2. Use React Testing Library's `wait` utility
3. Put this assertion in another test (the premise of this article)

```tsx
// 1. Wait for the promise to resolve
// ⚠️ this is an ok way to solve this problem, but there's a better way, read on
test('course shows loading screen', async () => {
  const promise = Promise.resolve(buildCourse())
  getCourseInfo.mockImplementationOnce(() => promise)
  render(<Course courseId="123" />)
  const alert = screen.getByRole('alert')
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)
  await act(() => promise)
})
```

This is actually not all that bad. I would recommend this if there are no
observable changes to the DOM. I had a situation like this in a UI I built where
I had implemented an optimistic update (meaning the DOM update happened before
the request finished) and therefore had no way to wait for/assert on changes in
the DOM.

```tsx
// 2. Use React Testing Library's `wait` utility
test('course shows loading screen', async () => {
  getCourseInfo.mockResolvedValueOnce(buildCourse())
  render(<Course courseId="123" />)
  const alert = screen.getByRole('alert')
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(/loading/i)
  await wait()
})
```

This only really works if the mock you've created resolves immediately, which is
most likely (especially if you're using `mockResolvedValueOnce`). Here you don't
have to use `act` directly, but this test is basically just ignoring everything
that happened during that waiting time which is why I don't really recommend
this.

The last (and best) recommendation I have for you is to just include this
assertion in the other tests of your component. There's not a whole lot of value
out of keeping this assertion all by itself.
