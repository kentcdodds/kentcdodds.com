Well here we are at the end of another year, and here's my own review of what
happened this year in my life.

## Epic things

The biggest thing that happened professionally this year was the launch of
[Epic Web](https://www.epicweb.dev) and the
[Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack). Those required their
own post, so I wrote that up separately and you can read all about how that came
to be in [Launching Epic Web](/blog/launching-epic-web).

This was really a big deal for me!

## Conferences

You can find my travel history (and future) on my
[travel map](https://kcd.im/map). In 2023, I spoke at the following conferences:

- [Agent Conf](https://agent.sh) in Dornbirn, Austria
- [QCon London](https://qconlondon.com/) in London, England
- [CityJS London](https://london.cityjsconf.org/) in London, England
- [React Miami](https://react-miami.com/) in Miami, Florida
- [Remix Conf](https://remix.run/conf) in Salt Lake City, Utah
- [JSDay Canarias](https://jsdaycanarias.com/) in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,
  Spain
- [React Rally](https://www.reactrally.com) in Salt Lake City, Utah
- [UtahJS Conf](https://conf.utahjs.com/) in Salt Lake City, Utah
- [React Live](https://reactlive.nl/) in Amsterdam, Netherlands

Pretty busy year for conferences for me. My wife and I had our 5th child in
November though, so I'm easing off a little bit for 2024. I've still got some
pretty sweet plans though. Stay tuned.

I want to call out a couple things though.

First, Agent Conf was unbelievable. Aside from the organizer
([Guntram](https://twitter.com/guntrambechtold)) just being a stellar person who
put together an amazing event. Skiing in the Alps was unforgettable (though I
must say I'm partial to Utah snow).

I also had a great time at CityJS and really enjoyed spending **6 hours** at
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child part 1 and 2 back-to-back with my friends
[Ruben Casas](https://twitter.com/Infoxicador) and
[Adrien Baron](https://twitter.com/BaronAdri).

As is customary, I rode my onewheel to the airport on my way home from React
Miami 😅

Even though
[I'm no longer at Remix](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/a-review-of-my-time-at-remix),
the Remix team asked me to organize Remix Conf and I had a great time doing
that. The Remix community is really special and I love getting together with
these folks.

I took some time in Amsterdam to explore the Netherlands and it was beautiful!

## Personal

The biggest thing that happened in my personal life this year was the birth of
my 5th child. I don't post pictures of my kids online, but I will say that I'm
very grateful for my wife and kids. They're the best. I'm so grateful my wife
and my new son are healthy and happy!

Earlier this year we took our kids to Disneyland for the first time. It was
fantastic. My oldest daughter is 11 and she's willing to go on almost all the
rides with me (except for Guardians of the Galaxy 😅). We had an awesome time
(Rise of the Resistance is incredible).

## Random things

I went snowboarding a lot (we had a record breaking winter in Utah).

I also went riding on my onewheel a lot (summer time was beautiful as always).

After a couple years of a break (due to [my car wreck](/blog/my-car-accident)),
I tried a backflip again. I still got it!

I ran a 10k with my 9 year old son. He's amazing.

My wife made a cake for me in the theme of Epic Web. She's amazing.

I started and beat The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the
Kingdom!

## Conclusion

It's cool to look back on 2023 and think of all the good times. I love looking
through pictures of the experiences I had with family and friends. The older I
get, the more I come to appreciate the relationships I have with other people.

As the world gets somehow even more digital, I'm clinging to these real human
relationships harder than ever and I hope you are too. I'm convinced that the
greatest happiness is only achieved by cultivating meaningful relationships with
other people.

So, onto 2024!
