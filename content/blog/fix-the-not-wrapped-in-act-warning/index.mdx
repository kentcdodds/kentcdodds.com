import {
  Rendered,
  UsernameForm,
  UsernameFormClass,
  UsernameFormClassWithBug,
} from './components'

Imagine you have a component like this:

<Rendered>
  <UsernameFormClass
    updateUsername={u =>
      new Promise(resolve => {
        alert(`You typed ${u}! Updating the database...`)
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), 2000)
      })
    }
  />
</Rendered>

Here's the code for that (if you were to do it with class components, don't
worry a function version is coming later in the post):

```tsx
class UsernameFormClass extends React.Component {
  state = {status: 'idle', error: null}
  handleSubmit = async event => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const newUsername = event.target.elements.username.value
    this.setState({status: 'pending'})
    try {
      await this.props.updateUsername(newUsername)
      this.setState({status: 'fulfilled'})
    } catch (e) {
      this.setState({status: 'rejected', error: e})
    }
  }
  render() {
    const {error, status} = this.state

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <input id="username" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        <span>{status === 'pending' ? 'Saving...' : null}</span>
        <span>{status === 'rejected' ? error.message : null}</span>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

So, let's imagine we want to write a test for this. Here's what you might write
to verify that the component is working properly:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import user from '@testing-library/user-event'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'

test('calls updateUsername with the new username', async () => {
  const handleUpdateUsername = jest.fn()
  const fakeUsername = 'sonicthehedgehog'

  render(<UsernameForm updateUsername={handleUpdateUsername} />)

  const usernameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/username/i)
  user.type(usernameInput, fakeUsername)
  user.click(screen.getByText(/submit/i))

  expect(handleUpdateUsername).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUsername)
})
```

Great! So now, if we make some sort of typo and not call the `updateUsername`
function or we forget to call it with the new username then our test will fail
and it provides us value.

But, what if we rewrite this to a function component with hooks? Let's try that:

```tsx
function UsernameForm({updateUsername}) {
  const [{status, error}, setState] = React.useState({
    status: 'idle',
    error: null,
  })

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const newUsername = event.target.elements.username.value
    setState({status: 'pending'})
    try {
      await updateUsername(newUsername)
      setState({status: 'fulfilled'})
    } catch (e) {
      setState({status: 'rejected', error: e})
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
      <input id="username" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      <span>{status === 'pending' ? 'Saving...' : null}</span>
      <span>{status === 'rejected' ? error.message : null}</span>
    </form>
  )
}
```

And the cool thing about React Testing Library is because it's free of
implementation details we can run those exact same tests with this refactored
version of our component.

## The dreaded `act(...)` warning

Unfortunately, if we try that, we'll get this really annoying warning in the
console that looks like this:

```
console.error node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:530
  Warning: An update to UsernameForm inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

  When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

  act(() => {
    /* fire events that update state */
  });
  /* assert on the output */

  This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://fb.me/react-wrap-tests-with-act
      in UsernameForm
```

What the!? So what's going on here? Well, you might not have noticed, but our
test didn't test our component's happy-path fully and left one important aspect
vulnerable to regressions. Let's go back to the class version and comment out an
important line of code:

```tsx [9]
class UsernameFormClass extends React.Component {
  state = {status: 'idle', error: null}
  handleSubmit = async event => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const newUsername = event.target.elements.username.value
    this.setState({status: 'pending'})
    try {
      await this.props.updateUsername(newUsername)
      // this.setState({status: 'fulfilled'})
    } catch (e) {
      this.setState({status: 'rejected', error: e})
    }
  }
  render() {
    const {error, status} = this.state

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <input id="username" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        <span>{status === 'pending' ? 'Saving...' : null}</span>
        <span>{status === 'rejected' ? error.message : null}</span>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

Guess what! Our tests still pass! But, the `Saving...` loading indicator next to
our submit button never goes away:

<Rendered>
  <UsernameFormClassWithBug
    updateUsername={u =>
      new Promise(resolve => {
        alert(`You typed ${u}! Updating the database...`)
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), 2000)
      })
    }
  />
</Rendered>

Oh no! It sure would've been nice if we'd had some warning that we weren't
testing all that our component was doing so we could've written a good test from
the start. Wait... Is that what `act` was yelling at us about? YES IT WAS!

So the `act` warning from React is there to tell us that something happened to
our component when we weren't expecting anything to happen. So you're supposed
to wrap every interaction you make with your component in `act` to let React
know that we expect our component to perform some updates and when you don't do
that and there are updates, React will warn us that unexpected updates happened.
This helps us avoid bugs like the one described above.

Luckily for you and me, React automatically handles this for any of your code
that's running within the React callstack (like click events where React calls
into your event handler code which updates the component), but it cannot handle
this for any code running outside of it's own callstack (like asynchronous code
that runs as a result of a resolved promise you are managing or if you're using
jest fake timers). With those kinds of situations you typically need to wrap
that in `act(...)` or `async act(...)` yourself. BUT, React Testing Library has
async utilities that are wrapped in `act` automatically!

## How to fix the `act(...)` warning

So, let's first thank the React team for letting us know that we didn't test
everything that's happening in our component (thanks React team! 🙏) and then
let's add an assertion to our test to cover the use case we forgot the first
time around:

```tsx [12]
test('calls updateUsername with the new username', async () => {
  const handleUpdateUsername = jest.fn()
  const fakeUsername = 'sonicthehedgehog'

  render(<UsernameForm updateUsername={handleUpdateUsername} />)

  const usernameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/username/i)
  user.type(usernameInput, fakeUsername)
  user.click(screen.getByText(/submit/i))

  expect(handleUpdateUsername).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUsername)
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.queryByText(/saving/i))
})
```

Great, so now we're waiting for the saving text to be removed and that ensures
that the saving text appears in the first place _and_ is removed when saving is
complete.

You'll notice that this test passes whether we're using class components or
function components (+1 point for avoiding
[Testing Implementation Details](/blog/testing-implementation-details)), but
without that extra line we only get the warning with function components not
class components. The reason for this is because the React team couldn't
reasonably add this warning for class components without creating a TON of new
warnings for people and their existing tests. So while the warning would
probably help people find and fix bugs like this, the decision was made to only
apply it to hooks so people would get the warning as they develop and test new
components (+1 point for using function components over class components).

You can read more about React's `act` utility
[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act), but again, you shouldn't
have to use it very often. It's built-into React Testing Library. There are very
few times you should have to use it directly if you're using
[React Testing Library's async utilities](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet#async).

If you're still experiencing the `act` warning, then the most likely reason is
something is happening **after your test completes** for which you should be
waiting (like in our earlier examples).

## An Alternative: waiting for the mocked promise

There's one alternative I want to show you that isn't quite as good for this use
case, but could be useful, especially if there's no visual indication of the
async task completing.

Because our code waits for the `updateUsername` promise to resolve before
continuing, we could return a promise from our fake version and use an async act
to await that promise resolution:

```tsx [2,3,13]
test('calls updateUsername with the new username', async () => {
  const promise = Promise.resolve() // You can also resolve with a mocked return value if necessary
  const handleUpdateUsername = jest.fn(() => promise)
  const fakeUsername = 'sonicthehedgehog'

  render(<UsernameForm updateUsername={handleUpdateUsername} />)

  const usernameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/username/i)
  user.type(usernameInput, fakeUsername)
  user.click(screen.getByText(/submit/i))

  expect(handleUpdateUsername).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUsername)
  // we await the promise instead of returning directly, because act expects a "void" result
  await act(async () => {
    await promise
  })
})
```

Note that we're manually calling `act` here and you can get that from
`react-dom/test-utils` or React Testing Library re-exports it so you can get
grab it from the import you already have. You're welcome.

This isn't preferable because it's still not going to catch the bug we
demonstrated earlier by commenting out that `setState` call, but it does make
the warning go away properly. I'd just recommend making additional assertions
about the way things look after the async action has completed.

## Other use cases for manually calling `act(...)`

If you're using all the React Testing Library async utilities and are waiting
for your component to settle before finishing your test and you're _still_
getting act warnings, then you may need to use `act` manually. Here are a few
examples:

### 1. When using `jest.useFakeTimers()`

Let's say you have a component that's checking against an API on an interval:

```tsx
function OrderStatus({orderId}) {
  const [{status, data, error}, setState] = React.useReducer(
    (s, a) => ({...s, ...a}),
    {status: 'idle', data: null, error: null},
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    let current = true
    function tick() {
      setState({status: 'pending'})
      checkStatus(orderId).then(
        d => {
          if (current) setState({status: 'fulfilled', data: d})
        },
        e => {
          if (current) setState({status: 'rejected', error: e})
        },
      )
    }
    const id = setInterval(tick, 1000)
    return () => {
      current = false
      clearInterval(id)
    }
  }, [orderId])

  return (
    <div>
      Order Status:{' '}
      <span>
        {status === 'idle' || status === 'pending'
          ? '...'
          : status === 'error'
          ? error.message
          : status === 'fulfilled'
          ? data.orderStatus
          : null}
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

So we've handled all the edge cases and cleaned up after ourselves nicely, but
when we write our test for it, we're going to get the `act` warning again:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import {checkStatus} from '../api'

jest.mock('../api')

beforeAll(() => {
  // we're using fake timers because we don't want to
  // wait a full second for this test to run.
  jest.useFakeTimers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers()
})

test('polling backend on an interval', async () => {
  const orderId = 'abc123'
  const orderStatus = 'Order Received'
  checkStatus.mockResolvedValue({orderStatus})

  render(<OrderStatus orderId={orderId} />)

  expect(screen.getByText(/\.\.\./i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0)

  // advance the timers by a second to kick off the first request
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000)

  expect(await screen.findByText(orderStatus)).toBeInTheDocument()

  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledWith(orderId)
  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

The `act` warning here is happening because of this line:

```tsx [4]
// ...
let current = true
function tick() {
  setState({status: 'pending'})
  checkStatus(orderId).then(
    d => {
// ...
```

The `tick` function is happening outside of React's callstack, so it's unsure
whether this interaction with the component is properly tested. React Testing
Library does not have a utility for jest fake timers and so we need to wrap the
timer advancement in `act` ourselves, like this:

```tsx [2,18]
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import {checkStatus} from '../api'

jest.mock('../api')

test('polling backend on an interval', async () => {
  const orderId = 'abc123'
  const orderStatus = 'Order Received'
  checkStatus.mockResolvedValue({orderStatus})

  render(<OrderStatus orderId={orderId} />)

  expect(screen.getByText(/\.\.\./i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0)

  // advance the timers by a second to kick off the first request
  act(() => jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000))

  expect(await screen.findByText(orderStatus)).toBeInTheDocument()

  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledWith(orderId)
  expect(checkStatus).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

And now the React `act(...)` warning goes away!

Notice, that we can pull React DOM's `act` testing utility directly from
`@testing-library/react` because it's simply re-exported by
`@testing-library/react` (cool right!?).

### 2. When testing custom hooks

You'll get an `act(...)` warning with custom hooks when you call functions that
are returned from your custom hook which result in state updates. Here's a
simple example of that:

```js
import * as React from 'react'

function useCount() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1)
  return {count, increment, decrement}
}

export default useCount
```

Here, we'll use `@testing-library/react` to validate our hook works:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import {renderHook} from '@testing-library/react'
import useCount from '../use-count'

test('increment and decrement updates the count', () => {
  const {result} = renderHook(() => useCount())
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)

  result.current.increment()
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)

  result.current.decrement()
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

When we call the `increment` and `decrement` functions from our hook, that
triggers a state update and because we're not in the React callstack we're going
to get an `act(...)` warning. So, let's wrap that in `act(...)`!

```js [2,9,12]
import * as React from 'react'
import {renderHook, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import useCount from '../use-count'

test('increment and decrement updates the count', () => {
  const {result} = renderHook(() => useCount())
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)

  act(() => result.current.increment())
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)

  act(() => result.current.decrement())
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

You'll notice that we're pulling `act` from `@testing-library/react` and that's
because it simply re-exports the `act` function from `react-test-renderer` so
you don't need to add an additional export. Nice right!?

### 3. When using `useImperativeHandle`

You may not have even heard of this hook, and if you have you may not have run
into this problem. That's because you only run into this if you're calling
methods directly on a component which do internal state updates and you're
outside of React's callstack. Let's read through an example of act warnings
popping up when testing components that use this hook.

So here's a pretty contrived example, but you should be double-thinking your
decisions any time you use this hook anyway:

```tsx
function ImperativeCounter(props, ref) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    increment: () => setCount(c => c + 1),
    decrement: () => setCount(c => c - 1),
  }))
  return <div>The count is: {count}</div>
}
ImperativeCounter = React.forwardRef(ImperativeCounter)
```

Here's how you might test this:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import ImperativeCounter from '../imperative-counter'

test('can call imperative methods on counter component', () => {
  const counterRef = React.createRef()
  render(<ImperativeCounter ref={counterRef} />)
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 0')).toBeInTheDocument()

  counterRef.current.increment()
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 1')).toBeInTheDocument()

  counterRef.current.decrement()
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 0')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

You'll get an `act` warning on those `increment` and `decrement` calls because
they're happening outside the React callstack. So, let's wrap them in `act`:

```tsx [2,10,13]
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import ImperativeCounter from '../imperative-counter'

test('can call imperative methods on counter component', () => {
  const counterRef = React.createRef()
  render(<ImperativeCounter ref={counterRef} />)
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 0')).toBeInTheDocument()

  act(() => counterRef.current.increment())
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 1')).toBeInTheDocument()

  act(() => counterRef.current.decrement())
  expect(screen.getByText('The count is: 0')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully you have a better understanding (and appreciation) for React's
(sometimes annoying but always right) `act(...)` testing utility and the next
time you get a warning you're able to identify the source of the problem and fix
it more quickly.

Again, most of the time you shouldn't actually have to use `act` directly
(thanks to
[React Testing Library's async utilities](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async)),
but when you do, you'll know why it's needed and fixes the problem.

Good luck!
