Remix has me more excited about building better websites than anything else
since I started using React back in 2015. I have so much to say about it, but
for this blog post, we're going to remove as many distractions as possible and
give remix the "super simple start" treatment. So, even though Remix has a fancy
`npm init remix` thing you can run (which is much easier than what I'm going to
show you), we're going to skip that and build a simple remix app from absolutely
nothing to running so we can inspect each bit required to get it going.

Before we get started, create a folder for our project. I'm going to be super
original and put mine on the desktop with the folder name
"super-simple-start-to-remix". Alright, now we're ready to go!

## 1. Get a license

<callout-warning>
  Remix used to be paid software but it's going open source soon. You'll have to
  wait until it's officially released before continuing. At which point I'll
  update this post with simplified instructions (because you won't need a
  license key anymore).
</callout-warning>

For now, let's imagine your key is `8398430662990a1fc7677ee4d349d9b4cc1e4163`.

## 2. Installing Remix

You install remix packages just like you install all other packages on `npm`,
except because it's paid software, Remix hosts it's own package registry for
remix packages. This means that you list `remix` packages in your `package.json`
and you can use `npm install` or `yarn add` or whatever like usual, but you need
to tell the package manager where to get the remix packages. You need to tell
`npm` that when it's installing remix packages, it needs to use remix's registry
instead of the official npm registry.

Here's how we do that. Create a file in your project called `.npmrc`:

```sh
# ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/.npmrc
@remix-run:registry=https://npm.remix.run
```

So now when npm comes across any package within the `@remix-run` scope, it'll
use the `npm.remix.run` registry. Go ahead and try installing one:

```
npm install @remix-run/node

npm ERR! code E403
npm ERR! 403 403 Forbidden - GET https://npm.remix.run/@remix-run%2fnode - Missing authorization
npm ERR! 403 In most cases, you or one of your dependencies are requesting
npm ERR! 403 a package version that is forbidden by your security policy.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /Users/kentcdodds/.npm/_logs/2021-05-03T22_34_06_763Z-debug.log
```

Oh yeah, we need to make sure the remix registry knows we're authorized to
download remix packages. The way we do this is by providing an `authToken` by
updating our `.npmrc` with this:

```
# ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/.npmrc
//npm.remix.run/:_authToken=8398430662990a1fc7677ee4d349d9b4cc1e4163
@remix-run:registry=https://npm.remix.run
```

BUT WAIT! We don't want to put our license right there in plain sight for anyone
to grab, especially if we plan on pushing this to source control. So instead,
we'll put our license key in an environment variable and reference that
environment variable.

So let's update the `.npmrc` to not reference our key directly, and interpolate
an environment variable instead:

```
# ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/.npmrc
//npm.remix.run/:_authToken=${REMIX_TOKEN}
@remix-run:registry=https://npm.remix.run
```

So now, try setting that variable and then installing. Here's how you do that on
macOS:

```
REMIX_TOKEN=8398430662990a1fc7677ee4d349d9b4cc1e4163

npm install @remix-run/node
```

SUCCESS!

Personally, I'm not a fan of setting that environment variable every time I open
a terminal window and need to install my dependencies, so I suggest you set that
environment variable on your system:

- [macOS](https://www.talkofweb.com/how-to-set-environment-variable-in-macos-catalina/)
- [Windows](https://www.alphr.com/environment-variables-windows-10/)

With that set up, we can now install the other packages we need to get things
started:

```
npm install react react-dom remix @remix-run/react
npm install --save-dev @remix-run/dev
```

## 3. Configuring Remix

Cool, with those things installed, let's configure Remix. Create a
`remix.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {}
```

Yup, that's all you need. The defaults all work fine, but remix won't build
without the config file, so we'll create that.

## 4. Building the app with Remix

Let's add a `build` script to our `package.json`:

```json [2-4]
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/node": "^0.17.0",
    "@remix-run/react": "^0.17.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "remix": "^0.17.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^0.17.0"
  }
}
```

Before we run that command though, we're going to need a few files:

```
mkdir app
touch app/entry.client.jsx
touch app/entry.server.jsx
touch app/root.jsx
```

Note: Remix supports TypeScript out of the box, but we're keeping this simple.
Also, because we plan to use JSX in these files, they need the `.jsx` extension.
Remix uses esbuild which requires a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension if you want to
use JSX.

Now, let's run the build:

```
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Built in 28ms
```

Success! Let's check out our file structure now. Here it is pre-build:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── entry.client.jsx
│   ├── entry.server.jsx
│   └── root.jsx
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── remix.config.js
```

And once we run `npm run build` remix creates a few files for us:

```sh [6-8,11-17]
.
├── app
│   ├── entry.client.jsx
│   ├── entry.server.jsx
│   └── root.jsx
├── build
│   ├── assets.json
│   └── index.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── build
│       ├── _shared
│       │   └── chunk-DH6LPQ4Z.js
│       ├── entry.client-LKK3OBJD.js
│       ├── manifest-C0FC4AB2.js
│       └── root-CJI57JUZ.js
└── remix.config.js
```

Sweet! We built it... Now what?

## 5. Coding our Remix App

Remix is a server-side rendering React framework. So far we've just got it
compiling things for us. Let's actually get a server running and show something
on the screen.

Let's start by filling in the `root.jsx` with something. This is the root
element Remix will render:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Remix App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

export default App
```

It's neat that we get to render the `<html>` element right? Yeah, that's cooler
than you think it is I promise you.

Ok, next, let's fill in the `entry.client.jsx`:

```tsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import {RemixBrowser} from 'remix'

ReactDOM.hydrate(<RemixBrowser />, document)
```

What's that? We're... HYDRATING the `document`?! How neat is that?!

And finally, let's fill in the `entry.server.jsx`:

```tsx
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'
import {RemixServer} from 'remix'

function handleRequest(
  request,
  responseStatusCode,
  responseHeaders,
  remixContext,
) {
  const markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
    <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
  )

  return new Response(`<!DOCTYPE html>${markup}`, {
    status: responseStatusCode,
    headers: {
      ...Object.fromEntries(responseHeaders),
      'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    },
  })
}

export default handleRequest
```

This one's pretty cool too. So we export a default function that accepts
everything we need, and _we_ get to return the response. That `Response` object
is a _real_ `Response` object (or, at least the node-equivalent of one).
[Learn more on freaking MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response)!
(Sorry, I just really love this part of Remix).

I really love how much control we get here. _We_ are in charge of calling
`renderToString` and `hydrate`. That gives us a lot of power and it also means
we don't need to learn extra special APIs Remix made for us and they don't need
to make extra-special options to customize any of this, because the control is
in our hands. Very cool.

One other thing I'll note is that the `remix` package is actually a lightweight
(and public) package that simply re-exports things from `@remix-run/node`
(server-side stuff) and `@remix-run/react` (client-side stuff).

## 6. Running our Remix server

Remix supports running just about anywhere. It has built-in support and adapters
for a growing list of environments including anywhere that runs express (and/or
docker containers), architect, and vercel (soon netlify, firebase, and
cloudflare workers). Depending on where you plan to deploy, you may want to use
the tools provided by that platform. For us, we'll go for the express approach.
We can create our own express server if we want, but since we don't need any
extra bells and whistles for our express server, we can use what's offered by
default from `@remix-run/serve`. So let's get that installed:

```
npm install @remix-run/serve
```

Note that this is a regular dependency because we'll use this to server our app
in production. Now let's add `dev` script to our `package.json`:

```json [4]
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix run"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/node": "^0.17.0",
    "@remix-run/react": "^0.17.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "remix": "^0.17.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^0.17.0"
  }
}
```

And now if we run `npm run dev` we'll get this output:

```
Watching Remix app in development mode...
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000
💿 Built in 102ms
```

That output shows that `remix run` does two things:

1. `Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000`: This comes from
   `remix-serve` which is running a simple express server based on what's in the
   `build` directory.
2. `💿 Built in 102ms`: This comes from `remix build` which is running in watch
   mode and development mode.

Whenever we make a change, the output in `build` is updated and the express
server picks up those changes.

One other thing `remix run` does is start a websocket with the browser to
support live reload. Currently there's no support for "Hot Module Replacement"
(HMR) and I'm actually totally cool with that. I never trusted HMR in apps
anyway (though it's awesome in tools like storybook) and always did a full-page
refresh even with HMR setup. Additionally, since a lot of the code you write
with remix is server-side, you typically want a full-page refresh anyway to get
all the server-side code to run again. All that said, HMR may come in the
future.

Ok, great, let's get this opened up! Navigate to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and poof:

![Browser window with the text "This is a remix app. Hooray!"" And a button with the number 0 in it](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620151304/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/app_ol57hw.png)

## 7. Hydrating our Remix app

But oh no! If we click that button nothings happens. Weird... I thought this was
a react app. Let's take a look at the network tab:

![Network tab showing two GET requests, one for the document and the other for a favicon](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620395539/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/network-tab_iyg7iy.png)

Notice anything missing? Oh yeah! No JavaScript! Yup, that's right, with Remix
you get to choose whether you load any JavaScript at all. And it's not a
configuration thing. Remember how we are in charge of the entire document
starting from `<html>`? Cool right? So let's update our `app/root.jsx` to
include the the script tag. Remix conveniently gives us a component we can
render to render that script tag:

```tsx [3,15]
// app/root.jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {Scripts} from 'remix'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Remix App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

export default App
```

Also that missing favicon thing is annoying so I'll add this cool CD as a
favicon:

<img
  style={{width: 60, display: 'block', marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto'}}
  alt="CD"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/w_120,f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1620153603/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/favicon_vsvcsr.ico"
/>

Just put that `.ico` file in the `public` directory. `@remix-run/serve` will
automatically serve files in that directory and the browser (which by looks for
that file by default) will be able to get it that way.

Neato, let's try that now:

![Network tab with scripts getting loaded](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620153551/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/network-tab-with-scripts_tdibpc.png)

And if we "view source" on the document here's what we get:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Remix App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
    <button>0</button>
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/build/_shared/chunk-UKIVUHZH.js" />
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/build/root-ZWUBXRA3.js" />
    <script>
      window.__remixContext = {
        matches: [
          {
            params: {},
            pathname: '/',
            route: {
              id: 'root',
              path: '/',
              module: '/build/root-ZWUBXRA3.js',
              hasAction: false,
              hasLoader: false,
            },
          },
        ],
        componentDidCatchEmulator: {
          trackBoundaries: true,
          renderBoundaryRouteId: null,
          loaderBoundaryRouteId: null,
          error: undefined,
        },
        routeData: {root: null},
      }
    </script>
    <script src="/build/manifest-6B36E634.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      import * as route0 from '/build/root-ZWUBXRA3.js'
      window.__remixRouteModules = {root: route0}
    </script>
    <script src="/build/entry.client-4YFGIIEC.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

So that's neat. Not only does Remix add script tags, but it also preloads things
for us, so we don't have a waterfall (you'll notice the network tab has all
resources starting to load at the same time). This gets even more interesting
when we start routing, but we'll keep things simple.

## 8. Running Production Mode locally

Alright, let's build and run this thing locally. So first we need to run the
production build to get everything minified and have React optimize itself for
production:

```
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Built in 52ms
```

Now, let's add a `start` script to run `remix-serve` for our `build` directory:

```json [5]
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix run",
    "start": "remix-serve build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/node": "^0.17.0",
    "@remix-run/react": "^0.17.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "remix": "^0.17.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^0.17.0"
  }
}
```

One other thing we'll want to do is set the `NODE_ENV` to `production` so any
dependencies we use that operate slightly differently in production mode will
work as expected, so let's add `cross-env` and set the `NODE_ENV` with that:

```json [5,11]
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix run",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production remix-serve build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/node": "^0.17.0",
    "@remix-run/react": "^0.17.0",
    "@remix-run/serve": "^0.17.0",
    "cross-env": "^7.0.3",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "remix": "^0.17.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^0.17.0"
  }
}
```

Cool, so let's get it started:

```
npm start

> @ start /Users/kentcdodds/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix
> cross-env NODE_ENV=production remix-serve build

Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

And if we open that up, we'll see it's working perfectly:

![The working app](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620155777/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/app-running-in-production_hnbdvy.png)

Hooray!

## Conclusion

You have a lot of options for actually deploying your Remix app to production
and when you set up Remix the easy way (via `npm init remix`) it'll let you
choose which supported service you'd like to use and it'll spit out all the
config and instructions to get started that you need, so I'm not going to cover
that here.

There is _so_ much more to remix, but this is a "super simple start" so I wanted
to do as little as possible to show you where all the moving pieces are to get
something up and running with Remix. Like I said, `npm init remix` makes all
this a snap, but hopefully this walkthrough helped you get an idea of what parts
of remix does what.

You can find the code for this walkthrough here:
