<callout-danger>

Please keep in mind that this is a
["Super Simple Start"](/blog?q=super+simple+start) article. That means that
target audience for this article is people who have experience with Remix and
are curious about how the bits and pieces work without all the nice things Remix
provides for you out of the box. Because of that, this article might make it
seem like Remix is harder to use than it really is. This is not a good article
to read if you're just getting started with Remix or want an introduction to it.

I'll write a good beginner's guide article soon.

</callout-danger>

Remix has me more excited about building better websites than anything else
since I started using React back in 2015. I have so much to say about it, but
for this blog post, we're going to remove as many distractions as possible and
give remix the "super simple start" treatment. So, even though Remix has a fancy
`npx create-remix@latest` thing you can run (which is much easier than what I'm
going to show you), we're going to skip that and build a simple remix app from
absolutely nothing to running so we can inspect each bit required to get it
going.

Before we get started, create a folder for our project. I'm going to be super
original and put mine on the desktop with the folder name
"super-simple-start-to-remix". Alright, now we're ready to go!

## 1. Installing Remix

We can install Remix together with the other packages we need to get things
started like we always do:

```sh
npm install react react-dom
npm install --save-dev @remix-run/dev
```

## 2. Configuring Remix

Cool, with those things installed, let's configure Remix. Create a
`remix.config.js`:

```js filename=remix.config.js
module.exports = {}
```

Yup, that's all you need. The defaults all work fine, but remix won't build
without the config file, so we'll create that.

## 3. Building the app with Remix

Let's add a `build` script to our `package.json`:

```json lines=2-4 filename=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^1.6.5"
  }
}
```

Sweet, let's run the build!

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Missing "entry.client" file in ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/app
```

Ah, yeah, let's add that file:

```sh
mkdir app
touch app/entry.client.jsx
```

And run the build again:

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Missing "entry.server" file in ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/app
```

Ok, let's add that one:

```sh
touch app/entry.server.jsx
```

And again:

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Missing "root" file in ~/Desktop/super-simple-start-to-remix/app
```

Maybe this is the last one?

```sh
touch app/root.jsx
```

Ok, let's run the build one more time:

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Built in 234ms
```

Success! Let's check out our file structure now. Here it is pre-build (ignoring
`node_modules`):

```sh
.
├── app
│   ├── entry.client.jsx
│   ├── entry.server.jsx
│   └── root.jsx
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── remix.config.js
```

And once we run `npm run build` remix creates a few files for us:

```sh lines=6-8,11-17
.
├── app
│   ├── entry.client.jsx
│   ├── entry.server.jsx
│   └── root.jsx
├── build
│   ├── assets.json
│   └── index.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── build
│       ├── _shared
│       │   └── chunk-DH6LPQ4Z.js
│       ├── entry.client-CY7AAJ4Q.js
│       ├── manifest-12E650A9.js
│       └── root-JHXSOSD4.js
└── remix.config.js
```

<callout-info>
  Note: Remix supports TypeScript out of the box, but we're keeping this simple.
  Also, because we plan to use JSX in these files, they need the `.jsx`
  extension. Remix uses esbuild which requires a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension if
  you want to use JSX.
</callout-info>

Sweet! We built it... Now what?

## 4. Coding our Remix App

Remix is a server-side rendering React framework. So far we've just got it
compiling things for us. Let's actually get a server running and show something
on the screen.

Let's start by filling in the `root.jsx` with something. This is the root
element Remix will render:

```tsx filename=app/root.jsx
import * as React from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Remix App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

It's neat that we get to render the `<html>` element right? Yeah, that's cooler
than you think it is I promise you.

Ok, next, let's fill in the `entry.client.jsx`:

```tsx filename=app/entry.client.jsx
import {RemixBrowser} from '@remix-run/react'
import {hydrateRoot} from 'react-dom/client'

hydrateRoot(document, <RemixBrowser />)
```

What's that? We're... HYDRATING the `document`?! How neat is that?!

And finally, let's fill in the `entry.server.jsx`:

```tsx filename=app/entry.server.jsx
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'
import {RemixServer} from '@remix-run/react'

export default function handleRequest(
  request,
  responseStatusCode,
  responseHeaders,
  remixContext,
) {
  const markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
    <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
  )

  responseHeaders.set('Content-Type', 'text/html')

  return new Response(`<!DOCTYPE html>${markup}`, {
    status: responseStatusCode,
    headers: responseHeaders,
  })
}
```

This one's pretty cool too. So we export a default function that accepts
everything we need, and _we_ get to return the response. That `Response` object
is a _real_ `Response` object (or, at least the node-equivalent of one).
[Learn more on freaking MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response)!
(Sorry, I just really love this part of Remix).

I really love how much control we get here. _We_ are in charge of calling
`renderToString` and `hydrate`. That gives us a lot of power and it also means
we don't need to learn extra special APIs Remix made for us and they don't need
to make extra-special options to customize any of this, because the control is
in our hands. Very cool.

Alright, let's try running the build again!

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
The path "@remix-run/react" is imported in app/entry.server.jsx but "@remix-run/react" was not found in your node_modules. Did you forget to install it?

✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "@remix-run/react"

    app/entry.client.jsx:1:29:
      1 │ import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
        ╵                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can mark the path "@remix-run/react" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error.


Build failed with 1 error:
app/entry.client.jsx:1:29: ERROR: Could not resolve "@remix-run/react"
```

Oh, right, we're using the `@remix-run/react` package for the `RemixBrowser` and
`RemixServer` components. Let's install that:

```sh
npm install @remix-run/react
```

Now let's try the build again:

```sh
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Built in 121ms
```

Sweet! It worked 🎉 So now we actually have something _real_ that'll run and
build. Onto the next step!

## 5. Running our Remix server

There are `@remix-run/{adapter}` packages that we can use for server-side
platform-specific stuff. Currently, here are all the adapters we can use
currently:

Deploy anywhere you can ship node and/or a docker container:

- `@remix-run/node`
- `@remix-run/express`
- `@remix-run/serve`

Deploy to specific platforms (serverless etc.):

- `@remix-run/deno`
- `@remix-run/architect`
- `@remix-run/vercel`
- `@remix-run/netlify`
- `@remix-run/cloudflare-workers`

And you can even build your own adapter. Most adapters are just a couple hundred
lines of code (and some aren't even that much).

The primary thing these adapters do is convert the Request/Response from the
platform-specific objects to the Web-standard Request/Response (or a polyfilled
version of that).

For our simple app, we're going to use `@remix-run/serve` which is built on top
of `@remix-run/express` which actually is built on top of `@remix-run/node`. So
this can deploy anywhere you can deploy a `node` server. The cool thing is that
if you want to deploy anywhere else you totally can and you just need to swap
out the adapter you're using in the `package.json` and so long as your own code
and other dependencies are supported by the platform, you should be good to go.

Let's install `@remix-run/serve`.

```sh
npm install @remix-run/serve
```

Alright, so we want to "develop" our app right? So let's add `dev` script to our
`package.json`:

```json lines=4 filename=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix dev"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/react": "^1.6.5",
    "@remix-run/serve": "^1.6.5",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^1.6.5"
  }
}
```

And now if we run `npm run dev` we'll get this output:

```
Watching Remix app in development mode...
💿 Built in 156ms
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000 (http://192.168.115.103:3000)
```

That output shows that `remix dev` does two things:

1. `Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000`: This comes from
   `remix-serve` which is running a simple express server based on what's in the
   `build` directory.
2. `💿 Built in 156ms`: This comes from `remix build` which is running in watch
   mode and development mode.

Whenever we make a change, the output in `build` is updated and the express
server picks up those changes.

One other thing `remix dev` does is start a websocket with the browser to
support live reload. Currently there's no support for "Hot Module Replacement"
(HMR) and I know that for a lot of people that's a ship stopper, but I encourage
you to stick around. Eventually HMR will be supported. Personally, I'm actually
totally cool with that. I never trusted HMR in apps anyway (though it's awesome
in tools like storybook) and always did a full-page refresh even with HMR setup.
Additionally, since a lot of the code you write with remix is server-side, you
typically want a full-page refresh anyway to get all the server-side code to run
again. Again, HMR will come in the future.

Ok, great, let's get this opened up! Navigate to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and poof:

![Browser window with the text "This is a remix app. Hooray!"" And a button with the number 0 in it](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620151304/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/app_ol57hw.png)

## 6. Hydrating our Remix app

But oh no! If we click that button nothing happens. Weird... I thought this was
a react app. Let's take a look at the network tab:

![Network tab showing two GET requests, one for the document and the other for a favicon](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620395539/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/network-tab_iyg7iy.png)

Notice anything missing? Oh yeah! No JavaScript! Yup, that's right, with Remix
you get to choose whether you load any JavaScript at all. And it's not a
configuration thing. Remember how we are in charge of the entire document
starting from `<html>`? Cool right? So let's update our `app/root.jsx` to
include the script tag. Remix conveniently gives us a component we can render to
render that script tag:

```tsx lines=2,14 filename=app/root.jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {Scripts} from '@remix-run/react'

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Remix App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Also that missing favicon thing is annoying so I'll add this cool CD as a
favicon:

<img
  style={{width: 60, display: 'block', marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto'}}
  alt="CD"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/w_120,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1620153603/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/favicon_vsvcsr.ico"
/>

Just put that `.ico` file in the `public` directory. `@remix-run/serve` will
automatically serve files in that directory and the browser (which by looks for
that file by default) will be able to get it that way.

Neato, let's try that now:

![Network tab with scripts getting loaded](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620153551/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/network-tab-with-scripts_tdibpc.png)

And if we "view source" on the document here's what we get (formatted):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Remix App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a remix app. Hooray!</p>
    <button>0</button>
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/build/_shared/chunk-PYN2BJX3.js" />
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/build/root-FYPD7R2X.js" />
    <script>
      window.__remixContext = {
        actionData: undefined,
        appState: {
          trackBoundaries: true,
          trackCatchBoundaries: true,
          catchBoundaryRouteId: null,
          renderBoundaryRouteId: null,
          loaderBoundaryRouteId: null,
          error: undefined,
          catch: undefined,
        },
        matches: [
          {
            params: {},
            pathname: '/',
            route: {
              id: 'root',
              parentId: undefined,
              path: '',
              index: undefined,
              caseSensitive: undefined,
              module: '/build/root-FYPD7R2X.js',
              imports: undefined,
              hasAction: false,
              hasLoader: false,
              hasCatchBoundary: false,
              hasErrorBoundary: false,
            },
          },
        ],
        routeData: {},
      }
    </script>
    <script src="/build/manifest-142295AD.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      import * as route0 from '/build/root-FYPD7R2X.js'
      window.__remixRouteModules = {root: route0}
    </script>
    <script src="/build/entry.client-UK7WD5HF.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

So that's neat. Not only does Remix add script tags, but it also preloads things
for us, so we don't have a waterfall (you'll notice the network tab has all
resources starting to load at the same time). This gets even more interesting
when we start routing, but we'll keep things simple.

## 7. Running Production Mode locally

Alright, let's build and run this thing locally. So first we need to run the
production build to get everything minified and have React optimize itself for
production:

```
npm run build

Building Remix app in production mode...
Built in 281ms
```

Now, let's add a `start` script to run `remix-serve` for our `build` directory:

```json lines=5 filename=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix dev",
    "start": "remix-serve ./build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/react": "^1.6.5",
    "@remix-run/serve": "^1.6.5",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^1.6.5"
  }
}
```

One other thing we'll want to do is set the `NODE_ENV` to `production` so any
dependencies we use that operate slightly differently in production mode will
work as expected, so let's add `cross-env` and set the `NODE_ENV` with that:

```json lines=5,10 filename=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix dev",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production remix-serve ./build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@remix-run/react": "^1.6.5",
    "@remix-run/serve": "^1.6.5",
    "cross-env": "^7.0.3",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@remix-run/dev": "^1.6.5"
  }
}
```

Cool, so let's get it started:

```
npm start

Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000 (http://192.168.115.103:3000)
```

And if we open that up, we'll see it's working perfectly:

![The working app](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1620155777/kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-remix/app-running-in-production_hnbdvy.png)

Hooray!

## Conclusion

You have a lot of options for actually deploying your Remix app to production
and when you set up Remix the easy way (via `npx create-remix@latest`) it'll let
you choose which supported service you'd like to use and it'll spit out all the
config and instructions to get started that you need, so I'm not going to cover
that here.

There is _so_ much more to Remix, but this is a "super simple start" so I wanted
to do as little as possible to show you where all the moving pieces are to get
something up and running with Remix. Like I said, `npx create-remix@latest`
makes all this a snap, but hopefully this walkthrough helped you get an idea of
what parts of remix does what.

You can find the code for this walkthrough here:

Enjoy!
