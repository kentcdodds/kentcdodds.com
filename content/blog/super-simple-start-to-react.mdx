When you're learning something new (or you want to solidify your foundational
understanding of something you're already familiar with), one of the most
valuable things you can do is remove _everything_ until all you're left with is
the _one_ thing you're trying to learn.

When we're talking about building applications, we're putting together many
different abstractions (tools and libraries) to do so. When all you want to do
is ship, it's natural to see all of those things as one big ball of rubber bands
where you don't know when one abstraction starts and the other ends and it
honestly doesn't really matter all that much because all you care about is
getting something shipped.

![Ball of Rubber bands](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033396/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-react/rubber-bands-ball.jpg)

But if you really want to get a solid foundation and use the abstractions to
their greatest potential, then you'll find you're much more effective by taking
those rubber bands apart and exploring them in isolation. You'll get to know
their capabilities and what role they play in the overall application. That way,
when you use them in the future, you won't try to put two pieces together in a
way they weren't intended, because you'll understand what their intended use
cases are.

So let's go ahead and try this with React. When we build a React application, we
use a ton of tools together (both development tools as well as libraries we ship
to production). If you don't know where react ends and webpack starts you won't
be as effective as using either. So, let's strip everything away and make it as
simple as possible: a straight-up `index.html` file.

The next little bit will basically be a simple version of what you can watch for
free in my [Beginner's Guide to React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react) course on
egghead. For this next part, you can
**[watch "Create a User Interface with Vanilla JavaScript and DOM" on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-vanilla-javascript-and-dom)**

https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-vanilla-javascript-and-dom

Let's start with a regular HTML file:

```html
<html>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

(Technically, you don't even need that much because the browser is very
forgiving when it comes to this kind of thing and it'll add the `html` and
`body` tags for you automatically. But let's keep those in.)

Alright, we're going to create DOM nodes using JavaScript and put them into a
container or "root" DOM node. So let's add that:

```html [3]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

We give it the `id` of `root` to make it easy to find that DOM node in our
JavaScript. Let's add that next:

```html [4-6]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Great, now that we have the `rootElement`, let's create a DOM element to put
inside it:

```html [6-9]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      const element = document.createElement('div')
      element.textContent = 'Hello World'
      element.className = 'container'
      rootElement.append(element)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now what you'll see on the page is "Hello World" that's rendered inside a `div`
within our `root`.

## Let's add React

For this next part, you can
**[watch "Create a User Interface with React's createElement API" on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-react-s-createelement-api)**

https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-react-s-createelement-api

Alright, let's add React to the page. It's a third party library, with
JavaScript of its own, so we need to add separate script tags to the page for
the browser to load that JavaScript for us:

```html [4]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      const element = document.createElement('div')
      element.textContent = 'Hello World'
      element.className = 'container'
      rootElement.append(element)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Great, with React on the page (as the global variable `React`), we can now start
creating React elements:

```html [7-16]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      // const element = document.createElement('div')
      // element.textContent = 'Hello World'
      // element.className = 'container'
      // rootElement.append(element)

      const element = React.createElement(
        'div',
        {className: 'container'},
        'Hello World',
      )
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Awesome. That `element` is a regular JavaScript object. Go ahead and log it to
the page and you'll see something like this:

```js
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element)
  key: null
  props: {className: "container", children: "Hello World"}
  ref: null
  type: "div"
  _owner: null
  _store: {validated: false}
  _self: null
  _source: null
  __proto__: Object
}
```

<callout-info class="aside">

</callout-info>

Now we've got to have something that can take that react element and turn it
into a DOM node and then put that DOM node in our `root`. That's what
`react-dom` is for. So let's add that:

```html [5,13]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      const element = React.createElement(
        'div',
        {className: 'container'},
        'Hello World',
      )
      ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now we'll have the same thing rendered as we had with our original vanilla
JavaScript solution.

## Adding JSX

For this next part, you can
**[watch "Create a User Interface with React's JSX syntax" on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-react-s-jsx-syntax)**

https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-a-user-interface-with-react-s-jsx-syntax

Nobody writes React like we have above though. We're all using
[JSX](/blog/what-is-jsx)! But the browser doesn't know what JSX is! So while we
like writing our code using this special syntax, we need to provide the browser
with something it understands. The browser understands `React.createElement`. So
what if we write our code using JSX, and then we have some tool that converts
JSX to `React.createElement`? That's precisely what the
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler does for us.

As it happens, Babel is written completely in JavaScript and can actually run in
the browser! So let's add it to our page:

```html [6]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="module">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      const element = React.createElement(
        'div',
        {className: 'container'},
        'Hello World',
      )
      ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And with that, now we can tell babel that we want it to compile the code we have
in the `script` tag. We do this by changing the `type` to `text/babel`:

```html [7]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      const element = React.createElement(
        'div',
        {className: 'container'},
        'Hello World',
      )
      ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now that we've got that set up, we can start using JSX!

```html [9-14]
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
      // const element = React.createElement(
      //   'div',
      //   {className: 'container'},
      //   'Hello World',
      // )
      const element = <div className="container">Hello World</div>
      ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And that's it! So here's the simplified and final version of everything you need
to get React running in an `index.html` file without any build tools whatsoever:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      ReactDOM.render(
        <div className="container">Hello World</div>,
        document.getElementById('root'),
      )
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Now, I wouldn't recommend building your whole app like this, but hopefully this
was instructive and helped you understand what the different parts of the React
fundamental abstractions are responsible for. Taking things apart from other
abstractions and adding them back one at a time can really help you understand
how these tools and libraries work alone and how you can best use them together
to build awesome stuff.
