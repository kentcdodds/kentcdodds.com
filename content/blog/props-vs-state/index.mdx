import {Rendered, Add, AddWithInput} from './components'

Let's compare props and state. Here's a definition of each:

- "props" (short for "properties") is an object of arbitrary inputs a React
  function component accepts as the first argument.
- "state" is data that changes over the lifetime of a specific instance of a
  React component.

Let's dive into each.

## Props

Think of props as arguments to a function. React components are functions which
return JSX (or more generally something that's renderable like React elements,
`null`, a string, etc.). Typically when you have a piece of code that you would
like to reuse, you can place that code into a function and any dynamic values
that code used before can be accepted as arguments (for example
`const five = 2 + 3` could be extracted to a function and accept arguments like
so `const five = add(2, 3)`).

The same is true of a piece of JSX, except instead of calling it like a normal
function (`add(2, 3)`) you use JSX syntax (`<Add n1={2} n2={3} />`). The
"attributes" supplied in the JSX are what are called `props` and they are placed
together in a single object and passed to the `Add` component function as the
first argument like so:

```tsx [1]
function Add(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.n1} + {props.n2} = {props.n1 + props.n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

If I were to use this like so:

```tsx
<Add n1={2} n2={3} />
```

Here's how that would be rendered:

<Rendered>
  <Add n1={2} n2={3} />
</Rendered>

<callout-info class="aside">
  NOTE: Props can be anything. In our example they're numbers, but they can also
  be (and often are) strings, arrays, objects, functions, etc.
</callout-info>

Let's say we want to default the `n2` to `0` in the event someone doesn't
provide it (like `<Add n1={2} />`). **One limit to props is that you're not
allowed to change them.** So you couldn't do something like this:

```tsx
function Add(props) {
  if (typeof props.n2 === 'undefined') {
    props.n2 = 0
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {props.n1} + {props.n2} = {props.n1 + props.n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

If we try to do this, we'll get the following error:

```
TypeError: Cannot add property n2, object is not extensible
```

This is simple enough to solve though:

```tsx
function Add(props) {
  let n2 = props.n2
  if (typeof n2 === 'undefined') {
    n2 = 0
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {props.n1} + {n2} = {props.n1 + n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Or, often, you'll find people use destructuring syntax with default values as
well (this is my personal preference):

```tsx
function Add({n1, n2 = 0}) {
  return (
    <div>
      {n1} + {n2} = {n1 + n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is awesome, but what if I want to dynamically change the props value? Let's
say I wanted to build something like this:

<Rendered>
  <AddWithInput n1={2} />
</Rendered>

Without state, here's how I might try to accomplish that:

```tsx [5]
function AddWithInput(props) {
  function handleInputChange(event) {
    const input = event.target
    const newN2 = Number(input.value)
    props.n2 = newN2
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {props.n1} +{' '}
      <input type="number" value={props.n2} onChange={handleInputChange} /> ={' '}
      {props.n1 + props.n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, this will not work for two reasons:

1. React doesn't know that we've updated the `n2` value of our `props` object,
   so it wont update the DOM when we change `props.n2`, so we wont see our
   changes anyway
2. We'll get the `TypeError` warning as before

This is where state comes in.

## State

State is data that changes over time, and that's perfect for our situation:

```tsx [2, 7]
function AddWithInput(props) {
  const [n2, setN2] = React.useState(0)

  function handleInputChange(event) {
    const input = event.target
    const newN2 = Number(input.value)
    setN2(newN2)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {props.n1} +{' '}
      <input type="number" value={n2} onChange={handleInputChange} /> ={' '}
      {props.n1 + n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

That will work, and this is precisely what React state is intended to be used
for. It's intended to track data values over the lifetime of the component (so
long as the component exists on the page).

However, users of the `AddWithInput` component can no longer set the initial
value of `n2` anymore. With the way that component is implemented currently,
it's not referencing `props.n2` at all. But we can make this work by using props
when we initialize our state:

```tsx
function AddWithInput(props) {
  const [n2, setN2] = React.useState(props.n2)

  // ... etc...
}
```

Now if someone were to do this: `<AddWithInput n1={2} n2={3} />` then the result
would look like this (notice that the initial input value is `3`):

<Rendered>
  <AddWithInput n1={2} initialN2={3} />
</Rendered>

So our props are "arguments" or "inputs" that we can pass to a component, and
state is something that is managed within the component and can change over
time.

Let me just clean this component up a little bit and I'll explain my changes:

```tsx [1, 2]
function AddWithInput({n1, initialN2 = 0}) {
  const [n2, setN2] = React.useState(initialN2)

  function handleInputChange(event) {
    const input = event.target
    const newN2 = Number(input.value)
    setN2(newN2)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {n1} + <input type="number" value={n2} onChange={handleInputChange} /> ={' '}
      {n1 + n2}
    </div>
  )
}
```

I changed to destructuring with defaults for the props, and I changed the prop
from `n2` to `initialN2`. When I'm using a prop value to initialize a state
value, I typically like to give it the prefix `initial` to communicate that
changes in that prop will not be taken into account. If that's what you want,
then you'll want to
[Lift State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

## Conclusion

I hope this helps clear up the difference between props and state in React for
you. It's a foundational concept. Go ahead and test yourself on this little app
below. Where's the state, where are the props?

I hope that's helpful! Good luck!
