Whenever there are two things to do the same thing, people inevitably ask: "When
do I use one over the other?" There are two possible reasons for having multiple
ways of doing the same thing:

1. One is the "old way" and the other is the "new (and improved) way". Typically
   the old way is kept around for backward compatibility reasons and the new way
   is the path forward for new code. For example: class components (old way) vs
   function components (new way).
2. They come with different trade-offs that should be considered and therefore
   should be applied in situations that suit them better (sometimes meaning
   you'll use more than one in a given application). For example:
   [`useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect`](/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect) or
   [Static vs Unit vs Integration vs E2E tests](/blog/static-vs-unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests)
   or
   ["Control Props" vs "State Reducers"](/blog/control-props-vs-state-reducers)

`useState` and `useReducer` fall into the second category here. So let's talk
about the trade-offs.

(and no, it's not a
[trick question](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1234534306707456000)
😂).

## Examples

I think the best way to discuss these trade-offs is through the lens of
examples. We'll look at two examples. One which suits `useState` better, and one
which suits `useReducer` better. This won't be enough to cover all of the
trade-offs, but hopefully can be a good starting point for us.

### Custom `useDarkMode` hook

I recently wrote this for my workshop projects
([for example](https://react-fundamentals.netlify.com)). It's pretty
interesting, so let's compare `useState` and `useReducer` implementations for
that:

#### `useState` implementation

I'll highlight the areas where we're interacting with the state:

```js [2-7,11]
function useDarkMode() {
  const preferDarkQuery = '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState(
    () =>
      window.localStorage.getItem('colorMode') ||
      (window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery).matches ? 'dark' : 'light'),
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery)
    const handleChange = () => setMode(mediaQuery.matches ? 'dark' : 'light')
    mediaQuery.addListener(handleChange)
    return () => mediaQuery.removeListener(handleChange)
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('colorMode', mode)
  }, [mode])

  return [mode, setMode]
}
```

Hopefully that makes sense. Basically we're saying, if the user's set their
preferences to dark mode, then we'll initialize our mode to `dark`, otherwise
we'll initialize to `light` and then return the `mode` and `setMode` and as the
mode changes (whether by calling `setMode` directly or as the user changes their
system preferences) we'll keep that value set in `localStorage` for future use.

#### `useReducer` implementation:

There are several ways you could write this with `useReducer`. I'll start out
with the typical way most people write reducers:

```js [3-17,21-27,30-35,40-43,56-59]
const preferDarkQuery = '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'

function darkModeReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'MEDIA_CHANGE': {
      return {...state, mode: action.mode}
    }
    case 'SET_MODE': {
      // make sure to spread that state just in case!
      return {...state, mode: action.mode}
    }
    default: {
      // helps us avoid typos!
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
    }
  }
}

// use the init function to lazily initialize state so we don't read into
// localstorage or call matchMedia every render
function init() {
  return {
    mode:
      window.localStorage.getItem('colorMode') ||
      (window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery).matches ? 'dark' : 'light'),
  }
}

function useDarkMode() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(
    darkModeReducer,
    {mode: 'light'},
    init,
  )
  const {mode} = state

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery)
    const handleChange = () =>
      dispatch({
        type: 'MEDIA_CHANGE',
        mode: mediaQuery.matches ? 'dark' : 'light',
      })
    mediaQuery.addListener(handleChange)
    return () => mediaQuery.removeListener(handleChange)
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('colorMode', mode)
  }, [mode])

  // We like the API the way it is, so instead of returning the state object
  // and the dispatch function, we'll return the `mode` property and we'll
  // create a setMode helper (which we have to memoize in case someone wants
  // to use it in a dependency list):
  const setMode = React.useCallback(
    newMode => dispatch({type: 'SET_MODE', mode: newMode}),
    [],
  )

  return [mode, setMode]
}
```

Wow, I think we can both agree that the `useState` version was WAY simpler! But
wait! We can drastically simplify the `useReducer` version by going against the
"grain" and not writing your typical redux-style reducer. Let's try that:

```js [3-10,14]
function useDarkMode() {
  const preferDarkQuery = '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useReducer(
    (prevMode, nextMode) =>
      typeof nextMode === 'function' ? nextMode(prevMode) : nextMode,
    'light',
    () =>
      window.localStorage.getItem('colorMode') ||
      (window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery).matches ? 'dark' : 'light'),
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(preferDarkQuery)
    const handleChange = () => setMode(mediaQuery.matches ? 'dark' : 'light')
    mediaQuery.addListener(handleChange)
    return () => mediaQuery.removeListener(handleChange)
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('colorMode', mode)
  }, [mode])

  return [mode, setMode]
}
```

That's a lot better than our other try with `useReducer`. But we basically
[implemented `useState` with `useReducer`](/blog/how-to-implement-usestate-with-usereducer).
And even then, it's still less clear than our `useState` version. So at the end
of the day, `useState` was a much better solution in this case.

### Custom `useUndo` hook

There's a great
[`useUndo` hook on GitHub](https://github.com/xxhomey19/use-undo). I took
inspiration from that for this example. Thank you
[Homer Chen](https://twitter.com/xxhomey19)!

(For these, almost everything is interacting with state, so... no highlights...)

#### `useState` implementation

```js
function useUndo(initialPresent) {
  const [past, setPast] = React.useState([])
  const [present, setPresent] = React.useState(initialPresent)
  const [future, setFuture] = React.useState([])

  const canUndo = past.length !== 0
  const canRedo = future.length !== 0

  const undo = React.useCallback(() => {
    if (!canUndo) return

    const previous = past[past.length - 1]
    const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)

    setPast(newPast)
    setPresent(previous)
    setFuture([present, ...future])
  }, [canUndo, future, past, present])

  const redo = React.useCallback(() => {
    if (!canRedo) return

    const next = future[0]
    const newFuture = future.slice(1)

    setPast([...past, present])
    setPresent(next)
    setFuture(newFuture)
  }, [canRedo, future, past, present])

  const set = React.useCallback(
    newPresent => {
      if (newPresent === present) {
        return
      }
      setPast([...past, present])
      setPresent(newPresent)
      setFuture([])
    },
    [past, present],
  )

  const reset = React.useCallback(newPresent => {
    setPast([])
    setPresent(newPresent)
    setFuture([])
  }, [])

  return [
    {past, present, future},
    {set, reset, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo},
  ]
}
```

Looks pretty ok right? It probably is, but there's actually a situation where
this could be pretty buggy. But first, I want to address a common misconception
people have about calling multiple state updaters in sequence (like we're doing
in each of those functions).

Often people think this means that you'll trigger a re-render for each call (so,
they're suggesting that calling `reset` would trigger three rerenders). First,
remember to focus on
[Fixing the slow render before you fix the re-render](/blog/fix-the-slow-render-before-you-fix-the-re-render),
but secondly, remember that React has a batch system so if you were to call
`reset` from an event handler or in a `useEffect` callback, it would trigger
only one re-render.

That said, if we were to call `reset` in an async function (like after making an
HTTP request), then that _would_ result in three re-renders. However, in the
future with concurrent mode those will be batched as well. So my main concern
isn't the re-renders.

My concern is with the insidious stale closure bugs in our code! Can you spot
them? There are three! I'll give you a hint, there's one in each of `undo`,
`redo`, and `set`, but there's not one in `reset`.

Here's a contrived example that would reveal this bug:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [state, {set}] = useUndo('first')

  React.useEffect(() => {
    set('second')
  }, [])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    set('third')
  }, [])

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

The printed result here would be:

```json
{
  "past": ["first"],
  "present": "third",
  "future": []
}
```

It should be:

```json
{
  "past": ["first", "second"],
  "present": "third",
  "future": []
}
```

So what happened to `"second"` in our situation? Ah! Turns out we're missing our
dependency on `set` in the effect dependency array. Silly goose. Let's add
those:

```tsx [6,10]
function Example() {
  const [state, {set}] = useUndo('first')

  React.useEffect(() => {
    set('second')
  }, [set])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    set('third')
  }, [set])

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

Great, save, reload... Wait wut? Oh no! Here's what happened when I added those:

```json
{
  "past": [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "second",
    "third",
    "... this goes on forever..."
  ],
  "present": "third",
  "future": []
}
```

But wait! Aren't we memoizing the `set` function? It shouldn't change unless its
dependencies change... Wait... That includes the `past` and `present` values...
And whoops! When we call `set` those values are changed, which leads to our
infinite loop!

Now, this may seem contrived, but a similar bug could come up if you were
updating the state based on network events and they came back in a different
order from when they were sent out. Either way, you just don't want to have to
think about this kind of thing right? Right.

So we can fix this problem with `useReducer`, but we can actually change our
`useState` implementation and side-step this issue and I thought you'd enjoy
that, so here it is:

```js
function useUndo(initialPresent) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({
    past: [],
    present: initialPresent,
    future: [],
  })

  const canUndo = state.past.length !== 0
  const canRedo = state.future.length !== 0

  const undo = React.useCallback(() => {
    setState(currentState => {
      const {past, present, future} = currentState

      if (past.length === 0) return currentState

      const previous = past[past.length - 1]
      const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)

      return {
        past: newPast,
        present: previous,
        future: [present, ...future],
      }
    })
  }, [])

  const redo = React.useCallback(() => {
    setState(currentState => {
      const {past, present, future} = currentState

      if (future.length === 0) return currentState

      const next = future[0]
      const newFuture = future.slice(1)

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: next,
        future: newFuture,
      }
    })
  }, [])

  const set = React.useCallback(newPresent => {
    setState(currentState => {
      const {present, past} = currentState
      if (newPresent === present) return currentState

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: newPresent,
        future: [],
      }
    })
  }, [])

  const reset = React.useCallback(newPresent => {
    setState(() => ({
      past: [],
      present: newPresent,
      future: [],
    }))
  }, [])

  return [state, {set, reset, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo}]
}
```

There are a few things I did to fix this issue:

1. I used state updater callbacks in when calling the state updater functions so
   I could receive the `currentState` as an argument. This meant that I didn't
   need to list the state as a dependency.
2. I combined all the state into a single object. I had to do this because there
   are situations where you need one value to determine another. For example, in
   `redo`, I need the value of `present` to update `past` and the value of
   `future` to update `present`.
3. I did the calculations for `canUndo` and `canRedo` within the state updater
   callbacks based on the `currentState` I receive from the arguments so I
   didn't need to list those in the dependency array.

That solves the issue we were having and it does so pretty well, but let's try
this same thing with `useReducer` to compare.

#### `useReducer` implementation

```js
const UNDO = 'UNDO'
const REDO = 'REDO'
const SET = 'SET'
const RESET = 'RESET'

function undoReducer(state, action) {
  const {past, present, future} = state
  const {type, newPresent} = action

  switch (type) {
    case UNDO: {
      if (past.length === 0) return state

      const previous = past[past.length - 1]
      const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)

      return {
        past: newPast,
        present: previous,
        future: [present, ...future],
      }
    }

    case REDO: {
      if (future.length === 0) return state

      const next = future[0]
      const newFuture = future.slice(1)

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: next,
        future: newFuture,
      }
    }

    case SET: {
      if (newPresent === present) return state

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: newPresent,
        future: [],
      }
    }

    case RESET: {
      return {
        past: [],
        present: newPresent,
        future: [],
      }
    }
  }
}

function useUndo(initialPresent) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(undoReducer, {
    past: [],
    present: initialPresent,
    future: [],
  })

  const canUndo = state.past.length !== 0
  const canRedo = state.future.length !== 0
  const undo = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: UNDO}), [])
  const redo = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: REDO}), [])
  const set = React.useCallback(
    newPresent => dispatch({type: SET, newPresent}),
    [],
  )
  const reset = React.useCallback(
    newPresent => dispatch({type: RESET, newPresent}),
    [],
  )

  return [state, {set, reset, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo}]
}
```

Wow, the `useUndo` thing itself is actually very simple now. If we had started
with `useReducer` from the get-go, we wouldn't have even considered adding
anything to our dependency array because those functions are so simple they
don't need anything. All the logic lives in our reducer. That helps us avoid the
issue naturally.

You may find it interesting that the switch cases in our reducer are basically
exactly what the contents of our functions were before we made the change.

<callout-success class="important">
  **When one element of your state relies on the value of another element of
  your state in order to update: `useReducer`**
</callout-success>

## Conclusion

So if you want some "rules" (NOT ESLINT RULES), here they are:

- **When it's just an independent element of state you're managing: `useState`**
- **When one element of your state relies on the value of another element of
  your state in order to update: `useReducer`**

Outside of these "rules," everything else is really subjective. Honestly, even
the "rules" are subjective because as I demonstrated, you can do everything you
want with either one.

Also, please note that this applies on a case-by-case basis. You can absolutely
use `useState` in the same component or hook that's using `useReducer`. And you
can have multiple `useState`s and multiple `useReducer`s in a single hook or
component. That's no problem. Separate state logically by domain. If it changes
together, it's likely better to keep together in a reducer. If something is
pretty independent from other elements of state in that hook/component, then
putting it with other elements of state is just adding unnecessary complexity
and noise to that reducer and you'd be better off leaving it out on its own.

So it's not just "when I have more than X number of `useState`s I switch to
`useReducer`." It's more nuanced than that. But hopefully this post helps you
understand those nuances and reach for the tool that has the trade-offs that
work best for your situation. In general, I suggest starting with `useState`,
and moving to `useReducer` when you notice elements of state need to change
together.

Good luck!
