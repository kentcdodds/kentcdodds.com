Have you ever seen a test go green and be surprised? You expect it to fail, but
it somehow passes and you don't know why. When that happens, do you:

1. Thank the testing gods for their blessing and move on?
2. Figure out what's going on?

If you answered `#1` then you're not alone! But I want to tell you why it's
important that you figure out what's going on because it's very possible that
you've written a test that cannot fail.

Consider the following tests:

```js
// __tests__/utils.js
import {isPasswordAllowed} from '~/utils'

test('allows passwords that are good', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3.efgh')).toBe(true)
})

test('disallows passwords less than 7 characters', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3.ef')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a non-alphanumeric character', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a digit', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab.')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain an uppercase letter', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('b3.')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a lowercase letter', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('A3.')).toBe(false)
})
```

Those look like pretty solid tests right? We've got a function called
`isPasswordAllowed` and it disallows passwords that are missing key
characteristics. These tests are all passing, but they're actually not
protecting us from our function breaking! Here, let me show you what I mean by
showing you the implementation of our function:

```js
// utils.js
function isPasswordAllowed(password) {
  return (
    password.length > 6 &&
    // non-alphanumeric
    /\W/.test(password) &&
    // digit
    /\d/.test(password) &&
    // uppercase letter
    /[A-Z]/.test(password) &&
    // lowercase letter
    /[a-z]/.test(password)
  )
}

export {isPasswordAllowed}
```

Can you tell what's wrong now? The problem is that for all these tests, the
reason the function returns `false` is because they aren't long enough, not
because they're missing characters. So, if I were to comment out one of these
lines, my tests would continue to pass anyway:

```js [8]
// utils.js
function isPasswordAllowed(password) {
  return (
    password.length > 6 &&
    // non-alphanumeric
    /\W/.test(password) &&
    // digit
    // /\d/.test(password) &&
    // uppercase letter
    /[A-Z]/.test(password) &&
    // lowercase letter
    /[a-z]/.test(password)
  )
}

export {isPasswordAllowed}
```

✅ All green! ✅

And this is why it's so important that once your test is passing, you go to the
source and ensure that if you break the functionality you're testing, that your
test will fail. Otherwise, someone could inadvertently break your code and the
tests wouldn't catch that. Those kinds of tests are worse than worthless because
not only do they not give you confidence, but they give you a false sense of
security which means you won't think to write good tests either.

Sometimes, code coverage can help you find places that you're missing, but in
our example above, those lines are covered by the first test that verifies the
function returns `true` for a valid password (under close scrutiny you might
notice the line hit count isn't high enough, but it's unlikely you'd notice
that).

Two other related issues I've see pretty often (and have fallen prey myself):

```js
expect(thing) // expectation with no assertion
expect(thing).toMatchSnapshot() // snapshot: empty...
```

You can avoid these common mistakes with
[`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest)'s
rules:

- [`valid-expect`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/master/docs/rules/valid-expect.md)
- [`prefer-inline-snapshots`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-inline-snapshots.md)

Also, in general, if you can find a better assertion than snapshots:
[use it](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/effective-snapshot-testing).

## Conclusion

Here's what a good test for that `isPasswordAllowed` function would be like:

```js
// __tests__/utils.js
import {isPasswordAllowed} from '~/utils'

test('allows passwords that are good', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3.efgh')).toBe(true)
})

test('disallows passwords less than 7 characters', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3.ef')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a non-alphanumeric character', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab3efgh')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a digit', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('Ab.efgh')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain an uppercase letter', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('b3.efgh')).toBe(false)
})

test('disallows passwords that do not contain a lowercase letter', () => {
  expect(isPasswordAllowed('A3.EFGH')).toBe(false)
})
```

With each of these, if I comment out the code that the test is specifically
testing for, the test will fail. So now I know that these tests are actually
providing me value rather than giving me a false sense of security and generally
being in the way of shipping.

Good luck!
