import * as Comps from './components'
import {UseUndoExample} from './use-undo.example'

If you're using `react@>=16.8`, then you can use hooks and you've probably
written several custom ones yourself. You may have wondered how to be confident
that your hook continues to work over the lifetime of your application. And I'm
not talking about the one-off custom hook you pull out just to make your
component body smaller and organize your code (those should be covered by your
component tests), I'm talking about that reusable hook you've published to
github/npm (or you've been talking with your legal department about it).

Let's say we've got this custom hook called `useUndo` (inspired by
[`useUndo`](https://github.com/xxhomey19/use-undo) by
[Homer Chen](https://twitter.com/xxhomey19)):

(Note, it's not super important that you understand what it does, but you can
expand this if you're curious):

<details>
  <summary>useUndo implementation</summary>

```js
import * as React from 'react'

const UNDO = 'UNDO'
const REDO = 'REDO'
const SET = 'SET'
const RESET = 'RESET'

function undoReducer(state, action) {
  const {past, present, future} = state
  const {type, newPresent} = action

  switch (action.type) {
    case UNDO: {
      if (past.length === 0) return state

      const previous = past[past.length - 1]
      const newPast = past.slice(0, past.length - 1)

      return {
        past: newPast,
        present: previous,
        future: [present, ...future],
      }
    }

    case REDO: {
      if (future.length === 0) return state

      const next = future[0]
      const newFuture = future.slice(1)

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: next,
        future: newFuture,
      }
    }

    case SET: {
      if (newPresent === present) return state

      return {
        past: [...past, present],
        present: newPresent,
        future: [],
      }
    }

    case RESET: {
      return {
        past: [],
        present: newPresent,
        future: [],
      }
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${type}`)
    }
  }
}

function useUndo(initialPresent) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(undoReducer, {
    past: [],
    present: initialPresent,
    future: [],
  })

  const canUndo = state.past.length !== 0
  const canRedo = state.future.length !== 0
  const undo = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: UNDO}), [])
  const redo = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: REDO}), [])
  const set = React.useCallback(
    newPresent => dispatch({type: SET, newPresent}),
    [],
  )
  const reset = React.useCallback(
    newPresent => dispatch({type: RESET, newPresent}),
    [],
  )

  return {...state, set, reset, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo}
}

export default useUndo
```

</details>

Let's say we want to write a test for this so we can maintain confidence that as
we make changes and bug fixes we don't break existing functionality. To get the
maximum confidence we need, we should ensure that our tests
[resemble the way the software will be used](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106).
Remember that software is all about automating things that we don't want to or
cannot do manually. Tests are no different, so consider how you would test this
manually, then write your test to do the same thing.

A mistake that I see a lot of people make is thinking "well, it's just a
function right, that's what we love about hooks. So can't I just call the
function and assert on the output? Unit tests FTW!" They're not wrong. It _is_
just a function, but technically speaking, it's not a
[_pure_ function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (your hooks are
supposed to be [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) though).
If the function were _pure_, then it would be a simple task of calling it and
asserting on the output.

If you try simply calling the function in a test, you're breaking
[the rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) and you'll get
this error:

```
Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
  1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
  2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
  3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
  See https://fb.me/react-invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.
```

(I've gotten that error for all three reasons mentioned ðŸ™ˆ)

Now, you _might_ start to think: "Hey, if I just mock the built-in React hooks
I'm using like `useState` and `useEffect` then I could still test it like a
function." But for the love of all things pure, please don't do that. You throw
away a LOT of confidence in doing so.

But don't fret, if you were to test this manually, rather simply calling the
function, you'd probably write a component that uses the hook, and then interact
with that component rendered to the page (perhaps using
[storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)). So let's do that instead:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import useUndo from '../use-undo'

function UseUndoExample() {
  const {present, past, future, set, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo} =
    useUndo('one')
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const input = event.target.elements.newValue
    set(input.value)
    input.value = ''
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={undo} disabled={!canUndo}>
          undo
        </button>
        <button onClick={redo} disabled={!canRedo}>
          redo
        </button>
      </div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="newValue">New value</label>
        <input type="text" id="newValue" />
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </form>
      <div>Present: {present}</div>
      <div>Past: {past.join(', ')}</div>
      <div>Future: {future.join(', ')}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export {UseUndoExample}
```

Here's that rendered:

<Comps.Rendered>
  <UseUndoExample />
</Comps.Rendered>

Great, so now we can test that hook manually using the example component that's
using the hook, so to use software to automate our manual process, we need to
write a test that does the same thing we're doing manually. Here's what that is
like:

```js
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import * as React from 'react'

import {UseUndoExample} from '../use-undo.example'

test('allows you to undo and redo', () => {
  render(<UseUndoExample />)
  const present = screen.getByText(/present/i)
  const past = screen.getByText(/past/i)
  const future = screen.getByText(/future/i)
  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/new value/i)
  const submit = screen.getByText(/submit/i)
  const undo = screen.getByText(/undo/i)
  const redo = screen.getByText(/redo/i)

  // assert initial state
  expect(undo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past:`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: one`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future:`)

  // add second value
  input.value = 'two'
  userEvent.click(submit)

  // assert new state
  expect(undo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past: one`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: two`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future:`)

  // add third value
  input.value = 'three'
  userEvent.click(submit)

  // assert new state
  expect(undo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past: one, two`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: three`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future:`)

  // undo
  userEvent.click(undo)

  // assert "undone" state
  expect(undo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past: one`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: two`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future: three`)

  // undo again
  userEvent.click(undo)

  // assert "double-undone" state
  expect(undo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past:`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: one`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future: two, three`)

  // redo
  userEvent.click(redo)

  // assert undo + undo + redo state
  expect(undo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past: one`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: two`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future: three`)

  // add fourth value
  input.value = 'four'
  userEvent.click(submit)

  // assert final state (note the lack of "third")
  expect(undo).not.toBeDisabled()
  expect(redo).toBeDisabled()
  expect(past).toHaveTextContent(`Past: one, two`)
  expect(present).toHaveTextContent(`Present: four`)
  expect(future).toHaveTextContent(`Future:`)
})
```

I like this kind of approach because the test is relatively easy to follow and
understand. In most situations, this is how I would recommend testing this kind
of a hook.

However, sometimes the component that you need to write is pretty complicated
and you end up getting test failures not because the hook is broken, but because
the example you wrote is which is pretty frustrating.

That problem is compounded by another one. In some scenarios sometimes you have
a hook that can be difficult to create a single example for all the use cases it
supports so you wind up making a bunch of different example components to test.

Now, having those example components is probably a good idea anyway (they're
great for [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for example), but sometimes it
can be nice to create a little helper that doesn't actually have any UI
associated with it and you interact with the hook return value directly.

Here's an example of what that would be like for our `useUndo` hook:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import useUndo from '../use-undo'

function setup(...args) {
  const returnVal = {}
  function TestComponent() {
    Object.assign(returnVal, useUndo(...args))
    return null
  }
  render(<TestComponent />)
  return returnVal
}

test('allows you to undo and redo', () => {
  const undoData = setup('one')

  // assert initial state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual([])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('one')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual([])

  // add second value
  act(() => {
    undoData.set('two')
  })

  // assert new state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual([])

  // add third value
  act(() => {
    undoData.set('three')
  })

  // assert new state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual(['one', 'two'])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('three')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual([])

  // undo
  act(() => {
    undoData.undo()
  })

  // assert "undone" state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual(['three'])

  // undo again
  act(() => {
    undoData.undo()
  })

  // assert "double-undone" state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual([])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('one')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual(['two', 'three'])

  // redo
  act(() => {
    undoData.redo()
  })

  // assert undo + undo + redo state
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual(['three'])

  // add fourth value
  act(() => {
    undoData.set('four')
  })

  // assert final state (note the lack of "third")
  expect(undoData.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(undoData.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(undoData.past).toEqual(['one', 'two'])
  expect(undoData.present).toEqual('four')
  expect(undoData.future).toEqual([])
})
```

I feel like this test allows us to interact more directly with the hook (which
is why the `act` is required), and that allows us to cover more cases that may
be difficult to write component examples for.

Now, sometimes you have more complicated hooks where you need to wait for mocked
HTTP requests to finish, or you want to "rerender" the component that's using
the hook with different props etc. Each of these use cases complicates your
`setup` function or your real world example which will make it even more
domain-specific and difficult to follow.

This is why
[`@testing-library/react-hooks`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library)
exists. Here's what this test would be like if we use
`@testing-library/react-hooks`:

```js
import {renderHook, act} from '@testing-library/react'
import useUndo from '../use-undo'

test('allows you to undo and redo', () => {
  const {result} = renderHook(() => useUndo('one'))

  // assert initial state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual([])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('one')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual([])

  // add second value
  act(() => {
    result.current.set('two')
  })

  // assert new state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual([])

  // add third value
  act(() => {
    result.current.set('three')
  })

  // assert new state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual(['one', 'two'])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('three')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual([])

  // undo
  act(() => {
    result.current.undo()
  })

  // assert "undone" state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual(['three'])

  // undo again
  act(() => {
    result.current.undo()
  })

  // assert "double-undone" state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual([])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('one')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual(['two', 'three'])

  // redo
  act(() => {
    result.current.redo()
  })

  // assert undo + undo + redo state
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual(['one'])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('two')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual(['three'])

  // add fourth value
  act(() => {
    result.current.set('four')
  })

  // assert final state (note the lack of "third")
  expect(result.current.canUndo).toBe(true)
  expect(result.current.canRedo).toBe(false)
  expect(result.current.past).toEqual(['one', 'two'])
  expect(result.current.present).toEqual('four')
  expect(result.current.future).toEqual([])
})
```

You'll notice it's very similar to our custom `setup` function. Under the hood,
`@testing-library/react-hooks` is doing something very similar to our original
`setup` function above. A few other things we get from
`@testing-library/react-hooks` are:

- Utility to "rerender" the component that's rendering the hook (to test effect
  dependency changes for example)
- Utility to "unmount" the component that's rendering the hook (to test effect
  cleanup functions for example)
- Several async utilities to wait an unspecified amount of time (to test async
  logic)

<callout-info class="aside">
  Note, you _can_ test more than a single hook by simply calling all the hooks
  you want in the callback function you pass to `renderHook`.
</callout-info>

Writing a "test-only" component to support some of these requires a fair amount
of error-prone boilerplate and you can wind up spending more time writing and
testing your test components than the hook you're trying to test.

## Conclusion

To be clear, if I were writing and testing the specific `useUndo` hook, I would
go with the real-world example usage. I think it makes the best trade-off
between understandability and coverage of our use cases. But there are
definitely more complicated hooks where using `@testing-library/react-hooks` is
more useful.
