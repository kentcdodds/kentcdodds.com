Why doesn't this work?

```js
function getLogger(arg) {
  function logger() {
    console.log(arg)
  }
  return logger
}

let fruit = 'raspberry'
const logFruit = getLogger(fruit)

logFruit() // "raspberry"
fruit = 'peach'
logFruit() // "raspberry" Wait what!? Why is this not "peach"?
```

So, to talk through what's happening here, I'm creating a variable called
`fruit` and assigning it to a string `'raspberry'`, then I pass `fruit` to a
function which creates and returns a function called `logger` which should log
the `fruit` when called. When I call that function, I get a `console.log` output
of `'raspberry'` as expected.

But then I reassign `fruit` to `'peach'` and call the `logger` again. But
instead of getting a `console.log` of the new value of `fruit`, I get the old
value of `fruit`!

I can side-step this by calling `getLogger` again to get a new logger:

```js
const logFruit2 = getLogger(fruit)
logFruit2() // "peach" what a relief...
```

But why can't I just change the value of the variable and get the `logger` to
log the latest value?

The answer is the fact that in JavaScript, when you call a function with
arguments, the arguments you're passing are passed by value, not by reference.
Let me briefly describe what's going on here:

```js
function getLogger(arg) {
  function logger() {
    console.log(arg)
  }
  return logger
}

// side-note, this could be written like this too
// and it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever:
// const getLogger = arg => () => console.log(arg)
// I just decided to go more verbose to keep it simple
```

When `getLogger` is called, the `logger` function is created. It's a brand new
function. When a brand new function is created, it looks around for all the
variables it has access to and "closes over" them to form what's called a
"closure". This means that so long as this `logger` function exists, it will
have access to the variables in its parent's function and other module-level
variables.

So what variables does `logger` have access to when it's created? Looking at the
example again, it'll have access to `fruit`, `getLogger`, `arg`, and `logger`
(itself). Read that list again, because it's critical to why the code works the
way it does. Did you notice something? Both `fruit` and `arg` are listed, even
though they're the exact same value!

Just because two variables are assigned the same value doesn't mean they are the
same variable. Here's a simplified example of that concept:

```js
let a = 1
let b = a

console.log(a, b) // 1, 1

a = 2
console.log(a, b) // 2, 1 ‼️
```

Notice that even though we make `b` point to the value of variable `a`, we were
able to change the variable `a` and the value `b` pointed to is unchanged. This
is because we didn't point `b` to `a` per se. We pointed `b` to the value `a`
was pointing to at the time!

I like to think of variables as little arrows that point to places in the
computer's memory. So when we say `let a = 1`, we're saying: "Hey JavaScript
engine, I want you to create a place in memory with the value of `1` and then
create an arrow (variable) called `a` that points to that place in memory."

Then when we say: `let b = a`, we're saying "Hey JavaScript engine, I want you
to create an arrow (variable) called `b` that points to the same place that `a`
points to at the moment."

In the same way, when you call a function, the JavaScript engine creates a new
variable for the function arguments. In our case, we called `getLogger(fruit)`
and the JavaScript engine basically did this:

```js
let arg = fruit
```

So then, when we later do `fruit = 'peach'`, it has no impact on `arg` because
they're completely different variables.

Whether you think of this as a limitation or a feature, the fact is that this is
the way it works. If you want to keep two variables up-to-date with each other,
there is a way to do that! Well, sorta. The idea is this: instead of changing
where the arrows (variables) point, you can change what they're pointing to! For
example:

```js
let a = {current: 1}
let b = a

console.log(a.current, b.current) // 1, 1

a.current = 2
console.log(a.current, b.current) // 2, 2 🎉
```

In this case, we're not reassigning a, but rather changing the value that `a` is
pointing to. And because `b` happens to be pointed at the same thing, they both
get the update.

So, let's apply this solution to our `logger` problem:

```js
function getLatestLogger(argRef) {
  function logger() {
    console.log(argRef.current)
  }
  return logger
}

const fruitRef = {current: 'raspberry'}

const latestLogger = getLatestLogger(fruitRef)

latestLogger() // "raspberry"
fruitRef.current = 'peach'
latestLogger() // "peach" 🎉
```

The `Ref` suffix is short for "reference" which is to say that the value the
variable points to is simply used to reference another value (which in our case
is the `current` property of an object).

## Conclusion

There are naturally trade-offs with this, but I'm glad that the JavaScript
specification calls for function arguments to be passed by value rather than
reference. And the workaround isn't too much trouble when you have the need
(which is pretty rare because mutability makes programs harder to understand
normally). Hope that helps! Good luck!
