import TheSpectrumOfAbstraction from './the-spectrum-of-abstraction.tsx'

The [AHA Programming Principle](/blog/aha-programming) stands for "Avoid Hasty
Abstraction." I have specific feelings about how this applies to writing
maintainable tests. Most of the tests that I've seen in the wild have been
wildly on one side of the spectrum of abstraction: ANA (Absolutely No
Abstraction), or completely DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). (I made up ANA just
now).

<TheSpectrumOfAbstraction />

Finding a sweet spot in the middle of the spectrum of abstraction is key to
developing maintainable tests.

## ANA Testing

The best example of "Absolutely No Abstraction" I've seen in testing is for
[ExpressJS route handlers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). For you
to understand what I mean when I say "ANA is bad for testing" I'm going to give
you a typical test file and ask you to pretend you're going to maintain this
codebase and these tests. It's important for you to understand how this route
works. You're relieved that there are tests in place which will help you make
sure you're not going to break something. So now you're going to use the tests
to understand the nuances of the route handler.

Try to read this test and understand the one nuance between the two of them.

```js
import * as blogPostController from '../blog-post'

// load the application-wide mock for the database.
// I guess that means this is AANA (Almost Absolutely No Abstraction)
// but I didn't want to write out a whole db mock for this blog post ðŸ˜…
jest.mock('../../lib/db')

test('lists blog posts for the logged in user', async () => {
  const req = {
    locale: {
      source: 'default',
      language: 'en',
      region: 'GB',
    },
    user: {
      guid: '0336397b-e29d-4b63-b94d-7e68a6fa3747',
      isActive: false,

    cookies: {},
    query: {},
    params: {
      bucket: 'photography',
    },
    header(name) {
      return {
        Authorization: 'Bearer TEST_TOKEN',
      }[name]
    },
  }
  const res = {
    clearCookie: jest.fn(),
    cookie: jest.fn(),
    end: jest.fn(),
    locals: {
      content: {},
    },
    json: jest.fn(),
    send: jest.fn(),
    sendStatus: jest.fn(),
    set: jest.fn(),
  }
  const next = jest.fn()

  await blogPostController.loadBlogPosts(req, res, next)

  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    posts: expect.arrayContaining([
      expect.objectContaining({
        title: 'Test Post 1',
        subtitle: 'This is the subtitle of Test Post 1',
        body: 'The is the body of Test Post 1',
      }),
    ]),
  })
})

test('returns an empty list when there are no blog posts', async () => {
  const req = {
    locale: {
      source: 'default',
      language: 'en',
      region: 'GB',
    },
    user: {
      guid: '0336397b-e29d-4b63-b94d-7e68a6fa3747',
      isActive: false,

      latitude: 31.230416,
      longitude: 121.473701,
      favoriteFruit: 'banana',
    },
    body: {},
    cookies: {},
    query: {},
    params: {
      bucket: 'photography',
    },
    header(name) {
      return {
        Authorization: 'Bearer TEST_TOKEN',
      }[name]
    },
  }
  const res = {
    clearCookie: jest.fn(),
    cookie: jest.fn(),

    locals: {

    },
    json: jest.fn(),
    send: jest.fn(),

    set: jest.fn(),
  }
  const next = jest.fn()

  await blogPostController.loadBlogPosts(req, res, next)

  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    posts: [],
  })
})
```

Did you find the difference? Yeah! We expect to find a post in the first one and
not in the second one! Cool! Great job. But... what causes that? Why does
`blogPostController.loadBlogPosts(req, res, next)` call `res.json` with a blog
post in the first one and not in the second one?

If you didn't figure that out, don't feel bad and don't worry, I'll show you
later. If you did, you're probably really good at
["Where's Wally"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F) and that's
my point. Tests like this make it harder than it needs to be to understand and
maintain the tests.

Now imagine that there are twenty such tests in a single file. You think it's
terrible? Yes, it's pretty bad. Never seen tests like this before? You're lucky!
I've seen it a lot. Here's how it gets this way:

1. Engineer Joe joins a team
2. Joe needs to add a test
3. Joe copies a previous test that looks like what they need and modifies it for
   their use case.
4. Reviewers observe that the tests pass and assume Joe knows what they're
   talking about.
5. PR is merged.

Here's your litmus test:

<callout-success class="important">
  How easy is it to determine the difference between assertions of two similar
  tests and what causes that difference?
</callout-success>

Absolutely No Abstraction testing makes this very difficult.

## DRY Testing

I don't have time at the moment to give you a good example of a `DRY` test. Just
know that often what happens when people apply `DRY` to anything they typically
wind up being harder to maintain due to this process:

1. Engineer Joe joins a team
2. Joe needs to add a test
3. Joes copies a previous test that looks basically exactly like what they need
   and adds another `if` statement to the testing utility for their case.
4. Reviewers observe that the tests pass and assume Joe knows what they're
   talking about.
5. PR is merged.

Another thing that I see a lot in DRY testing is the overuse of `describe` and
`it` nesting + `beforeEach`. The more you nest and use shared variables between
tests, the harder it is to follow the logic. I write about this problem a little
bit in [Test Isolation with React](/blog/test-isolation-with-react) which I
recommend you read.

## AHA Testing

That first test is absolutely screaming for abstraction (which is the guiding
principle for AHA programming). So let's write a thoughtful abstraction for that
test. Now try to figure out what makes the difference in these tests:

```js
import * as blogPostController from '../blog-post'

// load the application-wide mock for the database.
jest.mock('../../lib/db')

function setup(overrides = {}) {
  const req = {
    locale: {
      source: 'default',
      language: 'en',
      region: 'GB',
    },
    user: {
      guid: '0336397b-e29d-4b63-b94d-7e68a6fa3747',
      isActive: false,
      picture: 'http://placehold.it/32x32',
      age: 30,
      name: {
        first: 'Francine',
        last: 'Oconnor',
      },
      company: 'ACME',
      email: 'francine.oconnor@ac.me',
      latitude: 51.507351,
      longitude: -0.127758,
      favoriteFruit: 'banana',
    },
    body: {},
    cookies: {},
    query: {},
    params: {
      bucket: 'photography',
    },
    header(name) {
      return {
        Authorization: 'Bearer TEST_TOKEN',
      }[name]
    },
    ...overrides,
  }

  const res = {
    clearCookie: jest.fn(),
    cookie: jest.fn(),
    end: jest.fn(),
    locals: {
      content: {},
    },
    json: jest.fn(),
    send: jest.fn(),
    sendStatus: jest.fn(),
    set: jest.fn(),
  }
  const next = jest.fn()

  return {req, res, next}
}

test('lists blog posts for the logged in user', async () => {
  const {req, res, next} = setup()

  await blogPostController.loadBlogPosts(req, res, next)

  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    posts: expect.arrayContaining([
      expect.objectContaining({
        title: 'Test Post 1',
        subtitle: 'This is the subtitle of Test Post 1',
        body: 'The is the body of Test Post 1',
      }),
    ]),
  })
})

test('returns an empty list when there are no blog posts', async () => {
  const {req, res, next} = setup()
  req.user.latitude = 31.230416
  req.user.longitude = 121.473701

  await blogPostController.loadBlogPosts(req, res, next)

  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    posts: [],
  })
})
```

Now can you tell? What's the difference between the first and the second test?
In the first our user is in London and in the second our user is in Shanghai!
Gee, sure would've been nice if our co-workers had told us we were working on a
location-based blogging platform (hey... now that's an interesting product idea
ðŸ¤”).

By adding just a little mindful abstraction, we've been able to make it much
more clear what actually matters in the difference of the inputs and outputs
leading to tests which make a LOT more sense and are WAY easier to maintain.

## AHA Testing with React

In a react world, I will sometimes have a `renderFoo` function that acts like
the `setup` function here. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import LoginForm from '../login-form'

function renderLoginForm(props) {
  render(<LoginForm {...props} />)
  const usernameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordInput = screen.getByLabelText(/password/i)
  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i)
  return {
    usernameInput,
    passwordInput,
    submitButton,
    changeUsername: value => userEvent.type(usernameInput, value),
    changePassword: value => userEvent.type(passwordInput, value),
    submitForm: () => userEvent.click(submitButton),
  }
}

test('submit calls the submit handler', () => {
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const {changeUsername, changePassword, submitForm} = renderLoginForm({
    onSubmit: handleSubmit,
  })
  const username = 'chucknorris'
  const password = 'ineednopassword'
  changeUsername(username)
  changePassword(password)
  submitForm()
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({username, password})
})
```

<callout-warning>
  Note: I would consider this pre-mature abstraction if you've only got two or
  three tests in the file that is using it and those tests are short. But if
  you've got some nuance you're testing (like error states for example), then
  this kind of abstraction is great.
</callout-warning>

## Nesting

I'd recommend you give [Avoid Nesting in Tests](/blog/avoid-nesting-in-tests) a
read.

## jest-in-case and test.each

If you're writing tests for a pure function, you're in luck because those are
often the easiest to test for. You can seriously simplify your tests by using a
simple abstraction that calls out VERY clearly the outputs and inputs.

For (contrived) example:

```js
import add from '../add'

test('adds one and two to equal three', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})

test('adds three and four to equal seven', () => {
  expect(add(3, 4)).toBe(7)
})

test('adds one hundred and two to equal one hundred two', () => {
  expect(add(100, 2)).toBe(102)
})
```

That's pretty simple to follow, but it can be improved with `jest-in-case`:

```js
import cases from 'jest-in-case'
import add from '../add'

cases(
  'add',
  ({first, second, result}) => {
    expect(add(first, second)).toBe(result)
  },
  [
    {first: 1, second: 2, result: 3},
    {first: 3, second: 4, result: 7},
    {first: 100, second: 2, result: 102},
  ],
)
```

I probably wouldn't bother doing this for this simple example, but what's cool
about it is that you can add more test cases very easily by simply adding more
elements to that array. A good example of this concept (that actually _doesn't_
use jest-in-case) is
[the `rtl-css-js` tests](https://github.com/kentcdodds/rtl-css-js/blob/b148865ce6a4c994eba292015b8f44b5dae7edaa/src/__tests__/index.js).
Contributors to this codebase find it very easy to add new test cases with this
structure.

This can also be applied to impure functions and modules as well, though it
takes a little bit more work.
([Here's a test that does this which I'm not totally proud of, but it's not too bad](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/blob/7bc29e41e46e73b4b57c0f975648a90a75c24c80/src/scripts/__tests__/lint.js))

I personally prefer [jest-in-case](https://github.com/atlassian/jest-in-case)
but Jest has a built-in
[`test.each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testeachtable-name-fn-timeout)
functionality that you may find useful.

## Conclusion

Certainly our tests could've been improved by providing better names and/or
comments as well, but our simple `setup` abstraction (by the way, that's called
a "Test Object Factory") doesn't really need them. So my point is: **it takes
less work to write and maintain tests that have mindful abstractions applied to
them.**

I hope that's helpful! Good luck!
