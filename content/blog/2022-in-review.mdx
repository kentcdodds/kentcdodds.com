I'd like to review my year, share some things that happened, both professionally
and personally, and share some things I'm looking forward to in 2023.

## The accident

2022 started off with a bang... literally.

[![Kent standing by a wrecked Tesla model 3 in a junkyard. It's completely crushed.](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1672331276/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/my-car-accident/car-in-daylight.jpg)](/blog/my-car-accident)

I've written about this at length in the
[My Car Accident](/blog/my-car-accident) post. That had a big impact on my life.
I'm lucky and grateful to be alive.

## Remix

At the tail-end of 2021,
[I joined Remix](/blog/how-i-help-you-build-better-websites) as the director of
developer experience. I covered a bunch of what I did in that role in the blog
post where I announced my departure:
[A review of my time at Remix](/blog/a-review-of-my-time-at-remix).

I loved working at Remix. They're a great crew and I'm thrilled they got
[bought by Shopify](https://remix.run/blog/remixing-shopify). I've never been
more bullish about Remix and its place in the web development ecosystem.

## Epic Web

I left Remix to start working full-time on something I've been planning for
years. In fact, I wrote about it in
[my 2010s decade in review post](/blog/2010s-decade-in-review#kcd-edu). I want
to have one place that has all the knowledge I've accumulated about web
development. This is what [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev) will be. You can
learn more about that project in my post
[I'm building EpicWeb.dev](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/i-m-building-epicweb-dev).

Since starting work on that, I've spent a _ton_ of time [live streaming](/live)
(like, measured in the hundreds of hours). I'm currently building the
application that will be the subject of most of the workshops, tutorials, and
articles for [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev). Starting in the new year I'll
be getting designs and implementing those designs, then I can start turning
those into workshops. Lots of fun stuff ahead!

## Conferences

I've had a [talks](/talks) page for a while, but this year I decided to create a
[map](https://kcd.im/map) to map out all the conferences I've been to and where
I'm going. Last year, I attended and spoke at 11 conferences all over the world:

1. [React Miami](https://www.reactmiami.com/)
1. [Reactathon](https://www.reactathon.com/)
1. [RenderATL](https://2022.renderatl.com/)
1. [ReactNext](https://www.react-next.com/)
1. [NodeTLV](https://www.nodetlv.com/)
1. [Infobip Shift](https://shift.infobip.com/)
1. [React India](https://www.reactindia.io/)
1. [infoShare](https://infoshare.pl/conference/)
1. [ThunderPlains Conf](https://www.thunderplainsconf.com/)
1. [All Things Open](https://2022.allthingsopen.org/)
1. [Modern FrontEnds Live!](/blog/my-modern-frontends-live-experience)

It was quite a lot of travel, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak at
so many conferences. It's an honor to be invited to speak in front of thousands
of developers every year and I'm excited about the conferences I'll be speaking
at next year as well. Here are the conferences I'm scheduled to speak at in 2023
so far:

1. [AgentConf](https://www.alpine-conferences.com/agent-conf-2023)
1. [City of London JS Conf](https://london.cityjsconf.org/)
1. [React Miami](https://www.reactmiami.com/)
1. [JSDay Canarias](https://jsdaycanarias.com/)
1. [Front Conference](https://frontconference.com/)

I have a soft invite from several other conferences that are currently being
planned out. I'm planning on [delivering workshops](/workshops) at many of these
as well and I'm hopeful that these workshops will be based on the content I'm
developing for [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev). Let's hope I can finish that
quickly! I need to deliver these workshops multiple times before I can record it
for use on [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev), so the sooner I get them ready
for these conferences, the better!

Also, whether I'm selected to speak or not, I'm definitely attending
[Remix Conf 2023](https://remix.run/conf/2023). Last year was awesome (and I'm
not just saying that because I organized it ðŸ˜‰).

If you're interested in having me speak at your conference, please
[reach out to me](/contact).

I love seeing and talking with so many people at these conferences. I'm
regularly inspired by the people I meet and talk with. If you and I have met,
just know that I really appreciate the time. And if we haven't yet, I'd love to
have the opportunity.

## My site

I decided to migrate my site from Postgres and Redis to SQLite. I did that
because I'm bullish on distributed SQLite through
[LiteFS](https://fly.io/blog/introducing-litefs/). You can read more about this
in my blog post
[I Migrated from a Postgres Cluster to Distributed SQLite with LiteFS](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/i-migrated-from-a-postgres-cluster-to-distributed-sqlite-with-litefs).
Unfortunately, I changed a LOT of things all at once in this migration and
there's one thing that's still causing a memory leak on my application. I'm
going to be looking into that soon, and once that's fixed then I can finally go
multi-region with my site again.

LiteFS is technically still not production ready, but... This is me:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1607902756194648069

I'm planning on using it for the app we build for
[EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev). I'm hopeful it'll be production ready by the
time I ship that ðŸ˜… That's why I bothered going through the pain of migrating my
own site to something that's not battle-tested yet. How do you suppose these
kinds of things get battle tested in the first place anyway!? ðŸ˜…

## The Future

In 2023, I'm hoping to ship the first batch of content for
[EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev). The first half of 2023 will involve a _lot_
of workshops. But we'll see how quickly I can get the app finished. If you want
to join me on my journey, [subscribe to my YouTube](https://kcd.im/YouTube) and
[join my discord](https://kcd.im/discord). And make sure that you sign up for
the mailing list on [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev) so you can be notified
when it's ready. I'll be sending along a bunch of articles and tutorials along
the way as well.

I couldn't be more excited about what the future has to offer. Stay tuned!
