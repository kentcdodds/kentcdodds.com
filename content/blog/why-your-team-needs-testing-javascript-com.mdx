Dear Boss,

Our team has been working hard to make the product serve our customers the best
we can. It's been a real challenge. One of our biggest problems is code quality.
We let too many bugs slip into production. We care deeply about code quality and
good user experience, but right now our testing strategy is basically "fix what
the users complain about."

There are plenty of reasons for this, but the bottom line is **we need to
automate our code quality** as much as possible. We can't halt development on
product features, improvements, and bug fixes every time we do a release to
manually ensure our code changes wont cause more regressions (and cost the
company money). We need to leverage the technology available to increase our
deploy confidence. And we need everyone on the team to be on the same page to be
as productive as possible.

This is why we're asking you for team licenses to
[TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com). It's the best place for
us to learn everything we need to get the confidence to ship our app free of
bugs and regressions. The best and the brightest in the industry recommend
TestingJavaScript.com for learning all about testing applications just like
ours. With team licenses, we can go through the mountain of available material
together and get onto common ground with regard to our product quality vision
and direction.

The author, [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com), is a highly respected
member of the community and we use open source software that he has created and
contributed to. He has deep knowledge of testing and has taught hundreds of
thousands of software engineers. He's even the author and maintainer of some of
the open source testing tools we plan to use.

Please do let us know if you have questions. We'd love to discuss it. To get
things started, go to
[the pricing section of TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com#pricing),
click on the "Click here for team discounts" button, and buy a license for each
member of the team.

Thanks.

– The team
