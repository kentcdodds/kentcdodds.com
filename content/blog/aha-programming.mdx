## DRY

[DRY (an acronym for "Don't Repeat Yourself")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself),
is an old software principle that Wikipedia sums up like this:

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
> representation within a system

This is generally a good practice that I typically subscribe to (though less
dogmatically than that definition seems to encourage). The biggest problem I've
had with [code duplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code) (aka
copy/paste, it's basically the antithesis of `DRY`) is discovering a bug in one
place, fixing it, then realizing that same bug was elsewhere and having to fix
it there as well.

Once, I inherited a codebase that made very heavy use of code duplication and
one time I had to fix a bug in eight different places! ðŸ˜± Talk about irritating!
Abstracting that code into a function that could be called anywhere it was
needed would've helped out a LOT.

## WET

There's another concept that people have referred to as `WET` programming which
stands for "Write Everything Twice." That's similarly dogmatic and over
prescriptive. [Conlin Durbin](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz)
[has defined this as](https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33):

> You can ask yourself "Haven't I written this before?" two times, but never
> three.

In that same codebase I mentioned above, there was some over-abstraction that
was even more harmful than duplication. It was AngularJS code and for several
AngularJS controllers, the code passed `this` to a function which would
monkey-patch methods and properties onto `this` in a way enhancing the
controller instance with certain abilities. A sort of pseudo-inheritance thing I
guess. It was SUPER confusing, hard to follow, and I was terrified to make any
changes to that area of the codebase.

The code _was_ reused in lots more than three places, but the abstraction was
bad and I wished that the code had been duplicated instead.

## AHA ðŸ’¡

`AHA` (pronounced "Aha!" like you just made a discovery) is an acronym I
[got from](https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1112819136147742720)
[Cher Scarlett](https://twitter.com/cherthedev) which stands for

> Avoid Hasty Abstractions

The way I think of this principle is beautifully described by
[Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) who
[wrote](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction):

> prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction

This is such a solid golden nugget of wisdom that I want you to read it again,
then read Sandi's blog post on the subject:
[The Wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction).
It's fantastic.

Here's another important related principle that I want to add:

> Optimize for change first

I think the key is that we don't know what the future of code will be. We could
spend weeks optimizing code for performance, or coming up with the best API for
our new abstraction, only to find out the next day that we made incorrect
assumptions and the API needs a complete rework or the feature the code was
written for is no longer needed. We don't know for sure. All we can really be
sure of is that things will probably change, and if they never do then we wont
touch the code anyway so who cares what it looks like?

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting anarchy. I'm just suggesting that we
should be mindful of the fact that we don't _really_ know what requirements will
be placed upon our code in the future.

So I'm fine with code duplication until you feel pretty confident that you know
the use cases for that duplicate code. What parts of the code are different that
would make good arguments to your function? After you've got a few places where
that code is running, the commonalities will scream at you for abstraction and
you'll be in the right frame of mind to provide that abstraction.

If you abstract early though, you'll think the function or component is perfect
for your use case and so you just bend the code to fit your new use case. This
goes on several times until the abstraction is basically your whole application
in `if` statements and loops ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­

A few years ago, I was hired to review a company's codebase and I used a tool
called [jsinspect](https://github.com/danielstjules/jsinspect) to identify
chunks of copy/pasted code to show them opportunities for abstraction. They had
a bunch of duplicated code and from my perspective looking in, it was obvious
what the abstractions should look like.

**I think the big takeaway** about "AHA Programming" is that you shouldn't be
dogmatic about when you start writing abstractions but instead write the
abstraction when it _feels_ right and don't be afraid to duplicate code until
you get there.

## Conclusion

I feel like a measured and pragmatic approach to software principles is
important. That's why I prefer `AHA` over `DRY` or `WET`. It's intended to help
you be mindful of your abstractions without giving hard-fast rules to when it is
or isn't ok to abstract some code into a function or module.

I hope that's helpful to you. If you find yourself mired in bad abstractions,
take heart! Sandi gives you some good steps for how to get out of that!

Good luck!
