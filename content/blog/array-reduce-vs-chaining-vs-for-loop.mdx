I've been in the process of moving some of my digital life around and one thing
that I've had to do is download all of my photos from Google Photos. Thanks to
the way those are organized, I found the need to rearrange them, so I wrote a
little node script to do it. What the script does is not entirely relevant for
this post so I'm not going to go into detail, (but
[here's the whole thing](https://gist.github.com/kentcdodds/59daa81d46ba51b926a6a2f044aa5ad6)
if you wanna give it a read-through). Here's the bit I want to talk about
(edited slightly for clarity):

```js
const lines = execSync(`find "${searchPath}" -type f`).toString().split('\n')

const commands = lines
  .map(f => f.trim())
  .filter(Boolean)
  .map(file => {
    const destFile = getDestFile(file)
    const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile)
    return `mkdir -p "${destFileDir}" && mv "${file}" "${destFile}"`
  })

commands.forEach(command => execSync(command))
```

Basically all this does is uses the linux `find` command to find a list of files
in a directory, then separate the results of that script into lines, trim them
to get rid of whitespace, remove empty lines, then map those to commands to move
those files, and then run those commands.

I shared the script
[on twitter](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1215785900413599744) and had
several people critiquing the script and suggest that I could have used `reduce`
instead. I'm pretty sure both of them were suggesting it as a performance
optimization because you can reduce (no pun intended) the number of times
JavaScript has to loop over the array.

Now, to be clear, there were about 50 thousand items in this array, so
definitely more than a few dozen you deal with in typical UI development, but I
want to first make a point that in a situation like one-off scripts that you run
once and then you're done, performance should basically be the last thing to
worry about (unless what you're doing really is super expensive). In my case, it
ran plenty fast. The slow part wasn't iterating over the array of elements
multiple times, but
[running the commands](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1215810104261369856).

A few other people suggested that I use Node APIs or even open source modules
from npm to help run these scripts because it would "probably be faster and work
cross platform." Again, they're probably not wrong, but for one-off scripts that
are "fast enough", those things don't matter. This is a classic example of
applying irrelevant constraints on a problem resulting in a more complicated
solution.

In any case, I did want to address the idea of using `reduce` instead of the
`map`, `filter`, then `map` I have going on there.

## With `reduce`

Here's what that same code would be like if we use `reduce`

```js
const commands = lines.reduce((accumulator, line) => {
  let file = line.trim()
  if (file) {
    const destFile = getDestFile(file)
    const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile)
    accumulator.push(`mkdir -p "${destFileDir}" && mv "${file}" "${destFile}"`)
  }
  return accumulator
}, [])
```

Now, I'm not one of those people who think that
[`reduce` is the spawn of the evil one](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1213077702300852224)
(checkout that thread for interesting examples of reduce), but I do feel like I
can recognize when code is actually simpler/more complex and I'd say that the
reduce example here is definitely more complex than the chaining example.

## With `loop`

Honestly, I've been using array methods so long, I'll need a second to rewrite
this as a for loop. So... one sec...

Ok, here you go:

```js
const commands = []
for (let index = 0; index < lines.length; index++) {
  const line = lines[index]
  const file = line.trim()
  if (file) {
    const destFile = getDestFile(file)
    const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile)
    commands.push(`mkdir -p "${destFileDir}" && mv "${file}" "${destFile}"`)
  }
}
```

That's not much simpler either.

**EDIT:** BUT WAIT! We can simplify this thanks to `for..of`!

```js
const commands = []
for (const line of lines) {
  const file = line.trim()
  if (!file) continue

  const destFile = getDestFile(file)
  const destFileDir = path.dirname(destFile)
  commands.push(`mkdir -p "${destFileDir}" && mv "${file}" "${destFile}"`)
}
```

Honestly I do think that's not a whole lot better than the traditional loop, but
I do think it's pretty simple. I think some people discount for loops because
they're "imperative", when they're actually pretty useful.

## My take

Often, I'm going to be choosing between chaining and `for..of` loops. If I have
a performance concern with iterating over the array multiple times, then
`for..of` will definitely be my selection of choice.

I don't often use `reduce`, but sometimes I'll try it out and compare it to
other options and go with that. I realize how subjective that sounds, but so
much of coding is subjective so 🤷‍♂️

I'd be interested to hear what you think. Reply to the tweet below and let me
