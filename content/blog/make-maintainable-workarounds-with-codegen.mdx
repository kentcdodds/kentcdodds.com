This last week [Andrew Blick](https://github.com/blicksky) filed
[an issue on](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/issues/334)
[`glamorous`](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/issues/334) indicating that
the UMD build of `glamorous` doesn't work with React 16. The problem is that
`glamorous` does a lazy-require for the
[`prop-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) module and apparently
when building the UMD bundle,
[rollup can't handle the CommonJS require](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1646)
and make the UMD pass it in from the `global` object.

You can see this problem
[in the](https://unpkg.com/glamorous@4.9.5/dist/glamorous.umd.js)
[`glamorous@4.9.5`](https://unpkg.com/glamorous@4.9.5/dist/glamorous.umd.js)
[UMD file](https://unpkg.com/glamorous@4.9.5/dist/glamorous.umd.js). The fact
that `PropTypes` isn't included at the top with `global.Glamor` and
`global.React` is an indication of the issue. If you look further down, you'll
also see: `PropTypes = require('prop-types')`and it's that `require` statement
which is the problem. It's not transpiled due to the aforementioned issue.

This is the part where we get frustrated at our tools and their authors right?

Definitely not! What we do is we
[file an issue with a reproduction](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/88c5fc2ac6dc941b22e7996af05d70ff)
and suggest a solution! Then we implement the solution when the maintainer says
they're good with the solution! Woo!

![The big bird saying yep](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033102/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/make-maintainable-workarounds-with-codegen/1.gif)

In my case, I had no idea where to start and I don't have time to look into it
any further (I did, just have my fourth kid less than two weeks ago afterall).
So I filed
[the issue with the reproduction](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1646)
in part to verify that the issue was Rollup. Then I started thinking about a
good workaround.

Here's where codegen comes in.
[`babel-plugin-codegen`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-codegen) is
a babel plugin I wrote inspired by my other plugin
[`babel-plugin-preval`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-preval). Both
of these ship with a [babel-macro](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-macros)
and they each have a companion package to make using that easier.

So I installed [`codegen.macro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codegen.macro)
and changed from a simple `PropTypes = require('prop-types')` to this:

```js
PropTypes = codegen`  
  if (process.env.BUILD_FORMAT === 'umd') {  
    module.exports = "(typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window : global).PropTypes"  
  } else {  
    module.exports = "require('prop-types')"  
  }  
`
```

What `codegen` does is it will take the string of code you provide and run it
like a regular module, then it takes the string of code that you export and will
replace itself with that string of code. Because this happens at build-time,
it's a great way to do these kinds of optimizations.

Note, generally it's advisable to avoid putting too much code in a string
because you lose a lot of benefits like syntax highlighting and lintability, so
if it's a fair amount of code in there, you can pull it out into another file
and do:

```js
PropTypes = codegen`module.exports = require('./prop-types-workaround')`
```

Anyway, these changes we've made will leave all the other builds as it was
before, but for the UMD build, it'll pull PropTypes from the global.

What I love about this kind of workaround is that because it's using a
`babel-macro`the magic involved is pretty optimized and localized. So it's much
more straightforward than other workarounds would be and literally took less
than 10 minutes.

I hope this is helpful to you! Good luck to you all! 👍
