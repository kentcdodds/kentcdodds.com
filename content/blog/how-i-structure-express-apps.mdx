[TL;DR–Explore the example repository](https://github.com/kentcdodds/express-app-example)

This is the typical structure I use for my medium-sized Node backends. For small
backends, I'd probably just put everything in one file and I might not bother
with build tooling.

## package.json

Let's start in the `package.json`. Here are the relevant bits:

```json
{
  "main": "index.js",
  "engines": {
    "node": "12.18.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-async-errors": "^3.1.1",
    "loglevel": "^1.6.8"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/cli": "^7.10.4",
    "@babel/core": "^7.10.4",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.4",
    "@babel/register": "^7.10.4",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node .",
    "build": "babel --delete-dir-on-start --out-dir dist --copy-files --ignore \"**/__tests__/**,**/__mocks__/**\" --no-copy-ignored src"
  }
}
```

### main

This is the entry for our server. So when we run `node .` in this directory,
this is the file that will be run.

### engines

This indicates to tools we use which version of node we intend the project to
run with.

### dependencies

`express` is a given (there are plenty of alternatives and if you use one of
them that's great, you may still be able to get something out of this blog post
regardless). For every Express.js app I have, I also use `express-async-errors`
because it allows me to write my middleware using `async/await` which is
basically a necessity for me. Much less error prone because it ensures that any
async errors will be propagated to your error handling middleware.

I like `loglevel` personally, there are lots of other tools for logging, but
`loglevel` is a good start.

### devDependencies

I compile all my stuff with Babel. This allows us to use syntax that's not quite
supported in our environment yet (mostly just ESModules) as well as handy
plugins like
[`babel-plugin-macros`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros).
Hence all the `@babel` packages:

- `@babel/core` is the core babel dependency. Everything else needs it.
- `@babel/cli` is for the `build` script to compile our source code to the
  output code that Node can run.
- `@babel/preset-env` makes it really easy to include all the typical language
  plugins and transforms we'll need for the environment we're building for.
- `@babel/register` is used during development.

If you're using TypeScript, then you may also want to add
`@babel/preset-typescript`.

I also use `nodemon` for watch mode (restarts the server when files are
changed).

### scripts

The `start` script simply runs `node .` which will run the `main` file (which we
have set to `index.js`).

The `build` script takes all of the files in `src` directory (short for
"source") and compiles them with babel to the `dist` directory (short for
distribution). Here's an explanation for all the options:

- `--delete-dir-on-start` ensures that we don't have old files hanging around
  between builds
- `--out-dir dist` indicates where we want the compiled version of the files to
  be saved
- `--copy-files` indicates that files that are not compiled should be copied
  instead (useful for `.json` files for example)
- `--ignore \"**/__tests__/**,**/__mocks__/**\"` is necessary so we don't bother
  compiling any test-related files because we don't need those in production
  anyway
- `--no-copy-ignored` since we're not compiling the ignored files, we want to
  indicate that we'd also like to not bother copying them either (so this
  disables `--copy-files` for the ignored files).

If you're using TypeScript, make sure to add `--extensions ".ts,.tsx,.js"` to
the `build` script.

## .babelrc.js

Here's what the `.babelrc.js` looks like:

```js
const pkg = require('./package.json')

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        targets: {
          node: pkg.engines.node,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

It's pretty simple. We compile all the code down to the version of JavaScript
syntax that supported by the `engines.node` value specified in our
`package.json`.

If we were using TypeScript (recommended for teams), then we'd also include
`@babel/preset-typescript` as well.

## index.js

Here's our entry file for the module (this is the `main` from `package.json`):

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  require('./dist')
} else {
  require('nodemon')({script: 'dev.js'})
}
```

When we run our app in production, it's running on a server which has been
configured to set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `'production'`. So with
our `index.js` set up the way it is, in production, it will start the server
with the compiled version of our code.

However, when running the project locally, instead we'll require `nodemon` and
pass it the options `{script: 'dev.js'}` which will tell nodemon to run the
`dev.js` script, and re-run it when we make changes. This will improve our
feedback loop as we make changes to the server. There are a lot more options for
`nodemon`, and someone mentioned to me that
[`node-dev`](https://npm.im/node-dev) is another good project to look into so
you might give that a look as well.

## dev.js

This one's pretty simple:

```js
require('@babel/register')
require('./src')
```

The `@babel/register` sets up babel to compile our files "on the fly" meaning as
they're required, Babel will first compile the file before Node gets a chance to
run it. Then the `require('./src')` will require our `src/index.js` file which
is where things really start happening.

## src/index.js

This file is pretty simple:

```js
import logger from 'loglevel'
import {startServer} from './start'

logger.setLevel('info')

startServer()
```

All it does is configure the logger and starts the server. Most projects I've
seen actually kick off the server in the `src/index.js` file, but I prefer to
take the logic for starting the server and put it in a function because it makes
it easier for testing.

## src/start.js

Ok, here's where things really start getting "expressy". For this one, I'll
explain things in code comments.

```js
import express from 'express'

// this is all it takes to enable async/await for express middleware
import 'express-async-errors'

import logger from 'loglevel'

// all the routes for my app are retrieved from the src/routes/index.js module
import {getRoutes} from './routes'

function startServer({port = process.env.PORT} = {}) {
  const app = express()

  // I mount my entire app to the /api route (or you could just do "/" if you want)
  app.use('/api', getRoutes())

  // add the generic error handler just in case errors are missed by middleware
  app.use(errorMiddleware)

  // I prefer dealing with promises. It makes testing easier, among other things.
  // So this block of code allows me to start the express app and resolve the
  // promise with the express server
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    const server = app.listen(port, () => {
      logger.info(`Listening on port ${server.address().port}`)

      // this block of code turns `server.close` into a promise API
      const originalClose = server.close.bind(server)
      server.close = () => {
        return new Promise(resolveClose => {
          originalClose(resolveClose)
        })
      }

      // this ensures that we properly close the server when the program exists
      setupCloseOnExit(server)

      // resolve the whole promise with the express server
      resolve(server)
    })
  })
}

// here's our generic error handler for situations where we didn't handle
// errors properly
function errorMiddleware(error, req, res, next) {
  if (res.headersSent) {
    next(error)
  } else {
    logger.error(error)
    res.status(500)
    res.json({
      message: error.message,
      // we only add a `stack` property in non-production environments
      ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? null : {stack: error.stack}),
    })
  }
}

// ensures we close the server in the event of an error.
function setupCloseOnExit(server) {
  // thank you stack overflow
  // https://stackoverflow.com/a/14032965/971592
  async function exitHandler(options = {}) {
    await server
      .close()
      .then(() => {
        logger.info('Server successfully closed')
      })
      .catch(e => {
        logger.warn('Something went wrong closing the server', e.stack)
      })

    if (options.exit) process.exit()
  }

  // do something when app is closing
  process.on('exit', exitHandler)

  // catches ctrl+c event
  process.on('SIGINT', exitHandler.bind(null, {exit: true}))

  // catches "kill pid" (for example: nodemon restart)
  process.on('SIGUSR1', exitHandler.bind(null, {exit: true}))
  process.on('SIGUSR2', exitHandler.bind(null, {exit: true}))

  // catches uncaught exceptions
  process.on('uncaughtException', exitHandler.bind(null, {exit: true}))
}

export {startServer}
```

Doing things this way makes it easier to test. For example, an integration test
could simply do this:

```js
import {startServer} from '../start'

let server, baseURL
beforeAll(async () => {
  server = await startServer()
  baseURL = `http://localhost:${server.address().port}/api`
})

afterAll(() => server.close())

// make requests to the baseURL
```

## src/routes/index.js

This is where all the routes for my app come together:

```js
import express from 'express'
// any other routes imports would go here
import {getMathRoutes} from './math'

function getRoutes() {
  // create a router for all the routes of our app
  const router = express.Router()

  router.use('/math', getMathRoutes())
  // any additional routes would go here

  return router
}

export {getRoutes}
```

## src/routes/math.js

This is just a contrived example of some routes/middleware/express controllers.

```js
import express from 'express'

// A function to get the routes.
// That way all the route definitions are in one place which I like.
// This is the only thing that's exported
function getMathRoutes() {
  const router = express.Router()
  router.get('/add', add)
  router.get('/subtract', subtract)
  return router
}

// all the controller and utility functions here:
async function add(req, res) {
  const sum = Number(req.query.a) + Number(req.query.c)
  res.send(sum.toString())
}

async function subtract(req, res) {
  const difference = Number(req.query.a) - Number(req.query.b)
  res.send(difference.toString())
}

export {getMathRoutes}
```
