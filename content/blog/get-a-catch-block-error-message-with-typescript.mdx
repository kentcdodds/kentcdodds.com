title: Get a catch block error message with TypeScript

  TypeScript forces you to acknowledge you can't know what was thrown making
  getting the error message a pain. Here's how you can manage it.

Alrighty, let's talk about this:

```js
const reportError = ({message}) => {
  // send the error to our logging service...
}

try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error) {
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message: error.message})
}
```

Good so far? Well, that's because this is JavaScript. Let's throw TypeScript at
this:

```ts lines=9
const reportError = ({message}: {message: string}) => {
  // send the error to our logging service...
}

try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error) {
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message: error.message})
}
```

That `reportError` call there isn't happy. Specifically it's the `error.message`
bit. It's because (as of recently) TypeScript defaults our `error` type to
`unknown`. Which is truly what it is! In the world of errors, there's not much
guarantees you can offer about the types of errors that are thrown. In fact, it
might not even be an error that's thrown at all. It could be just about
anything:

```ts
throw 'What the!?'
throw 7
throw {wut: 'is this'}
throw null
throw new Promise(() => {})
throw undefined
```

Seriously, you can throw anything of any type. So that's easy right? We could
just add a type annotation for the error to say this code will only throw an
error right?

```ts lines=3
try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error: Error) {
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message: error.message})
}
```

Not so fast! With that you'll get the following TypeScript compilation error:

```
Catch clause variable type annotation must be 'any' or 'unknown' if specified. ts(1196)
```

The reason for this is because even though in our code we can clearly see that
there's no way anything else could be thrown, JavaScript is kinda funny and I'll
bet someone who reads this could figure out a way to make that code throw a
different kind of error than a regular `Error` object (PRs to this post with an
example are welcome).

So what's a dev to do? The very best they can! So how about this:

```ts lines=4-5,7
try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error) {
  let message = 'Unknown Error'
  if (error instanceof Error) message = error.message
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message})
}
```

There we go! Now TypeScript isn't yelling at us and more importantly we're
handling the cases where it really could be something completely unexpected.
Maybe we could do even better though:

```ts lines=4,6
try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error) {
  let message
  if (error instanceof Error) message = error.message
  else message = String(error)
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message})
}
```

So here if the error isn't an actual `Error` object, then we'll just stringify
the error and hopefully that will end up being something useful.

Then we can turn this into a utility for use in all our catch blocks:


```ts lines=1-4,14
function getErrorMessage(error: unknown) {
  if (error instanceof Error) return error.message
  return String(error)
}

const reportError = ({message}: {message: string}) => {
  // send the error to our logging service...
}

try {
  throw new Error('Oh no!')
} catch (error) {
  // we'll proceed, but let's report it
  reportError({message: getErrorMessage(error)})
}
```

This has been helpful for me in my projects. Hopefully it helps you as well.

## Conclusion

I think the key takeaway here is to remember that while TypeScript has it's funny bits, don't dismiss a compilation error or warning from TypeScript just because you think it's impossible or whatever. Most of the time it absolutely is possible for the unexpected to happen and TypeScript does a pretty good job of forcing you to handle those unlikely cases... And you'll probably find they're not as unlikely as you think.
