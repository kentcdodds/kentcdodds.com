I was one of the first users of Firebase back in the day. In fact, I spearheaded
their "torch program" for firebase advocates (this has been long discontinued
and was way before they were bought by Google). I was there when they announced
Firebase hosting. I've built a dozen or so small apps using Firebase for data
and/or authentication. But for one reason or another, I dropped off the firebase
bandwagon and tried some other services that treated me exceedingly well.

But now I'm back and I'm excited to try all that firebase now has to offer. In
particular, I'm playing around with [remix](https://remix.run) and I've just
added Firebase Firestore for data storage and want to add authentication.
Firebase Firestore + Firebase Authentication + Firebase Cloud Functions just
seems like the perfect combination. And while I've used
[Netlify's functions](/blog/super-simple-start-to-netlify-functions) feature,
Firebase is a bit of a different animal. Breaking things down to their most
basic and absolutely necessary components helps me get the right idea of the
abstractions I'm working with, so without any further ado, here's your "Super
simple start to Firebase functions."

## How to use Firebase Cloud Functions

Before you get started, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, a
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account (just use your Google account),
and a fresh repository. Once you've got the project locally on your computer,
then you can start with the following steps:

### Step 1: Create a Firebase project

![Firebase console showing an "Add project" button](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033386/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-1-firebase-console.png)

Go to [the firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and
create a new project. Follow the steps there (your option selections here don't
matter).

You will need to remember the name of your project. You can find it in the URL
after your project is created:

```
https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/{your-project-id-is-here}/functions
```

It's generated when you give the project a name, and you can change it at that
time as well:

![Let's start with a name for your project. Project name: My Awesome Firebase Thing. my-awesome-firebase-thin-33d3a. A unique identifier for your project](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033386/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-1-2-firebase-name.png)

### Step 2: Create a `firebase.json` file

For firebase to recognize your project as a firebase project, it needs to have a
`firebase.json` file. I'm sure there's lots of important config that can go in
here, but no config is needed for this super simple start, so just put in an
empty object:

```json filename=firebase.json
{}
```

### Step 3: Create a `.firebaserc` file

This file is where you actually associate your repository with the firebase
project (#spoileralert so when you run `firebase deploy` later, it knows which
project to deploy your code to).

Here's all you need in that file:

```json filename=.firebaserc
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "{your-project-id}"
  }
}
```

Make sure to change `{your-project-id}` to whatever your project ID is. Again,
you can get that from the URL of your project on the firebase console as
mentioned above. You can also get it from your project's settings page:

![Firebase console showing the setting page with the Project ID](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-3-project-id.png)

### Step 4: Create a `functions/package.json` file

Here's what you need in there:

```json filename=functions/package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "12"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "firebase-admin": "^9.3.0",
    "firebase-functions": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

`firebase-admin` and `firebase-functions` are _required_ dependencies to run a
Firebase Cloud Function. You technically don't have to use `firebase-admin` but
if you don't have it installed, your function won't deploy. We'll use
`firebase-functions` next.

`engines.node` is also required so Firebase knows which version of Node.js you
want your functions in.

### Step 5: Add `.gitignore`

Before we install these dependencies, let's get `.gitignore` ready to ignore
`node_modules`:

```
node_modules

# ignores a few log files firebase creates when running functions locally
*.log
```

### Step 6: Install function dependencies

```sh
cd functions && npm install
```

This should get all dependencies installed and it'll generate a
`package-lock.json` file which you can safely ignore for now (but you will want
to commit it to your repository).

### Step 7: Create a `functions/index.js` file

Now that you have dependencies installed, you can create your first function.

Here's what you'll put in there:

```js filename=functions/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions')

module.exports = {
  hello: functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
    const subject = req.query.subject || 'World'
    res.send(`Hello ${subject}!`)
  }),
}
```

Every property of that object you're exporting will be an individual function.
So with this, we have a single function called `hello`.

You might notice other folks use this syntax:

```js filename=functions/index.js
exports.hello = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {})
```

These are functionally equivalent. I just happen to prefer
`module.exports = {}`. But it doesn't make any substantive difference.

Also this file doesn't _have_ to be called `index.js`, but if you change it to
something else, then you'll need to set that in the `main` field in your
`package.json`. Easier to just go with the `index.js` convention I say.

### Step 8: Install `firebase-tools`

To deploy locally, you'll need to have `firebase-tools` installed so you can use
the `firebase` CLI:

```sh
npm install --global firebase-tools
```

Now you can login:

```sh
firebase login
```

That should pop open your browser and allow you to login with your Google
account. Go ahead and login. When you're done, you'll be logged in locally.

![Terminal output from the firebase login command](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-8-login.png)

### Step 9: Test locally

Now that you're logged in, you can test your firebase function before deploying
it to production. You can do so with
[firebase emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) which is
pretty sweet.

From within your project directory, run the following command:

```sh
firebase emulators:start
```

That does a bunch of stuff, but here's the important output:

```sh
i  emulators: Starting emulators: functions
... some irrelevant stuff here ...
✔  functions[hello]: http function initialized (http://localhost:5001/{your-project-id}/us-central1/hello).

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✔  All emulators ready! View status and logs at http://localhost:4000 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌───────────┬────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Emulator  │ Host:Port      │ View in Emulator UI             │
├───────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Functions │ localhost:5001 │ http://localhost:4000/functions │
└───────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
  Other reserved ports: 4400, 4500
```

If you open the Emulator UI, you'll see the emulator overview and you can select
the function logs:

![Emulator overview](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-9-emulator-overview.png)

If you hit your serverless function in a browser you should see the output:

![Browser saying "Hello World!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-9-fn-output.png)

And then your logs will show that the function was run:

![Function logs](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033386/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-9-fn-logs.png)

Awesome! So the function is working! On to the next step.

### Step 10: Deploy locally (maybe?)

Now you're ready to deploy your function to the world wide web. From within your
project directory, run the following command:

```sh
firebase deploy
```

This will trigger your function to be deployed.... But wait! What's this I see?

```sh
Error: HTTP Error: 400, Billing account for project '189225252738' is not found.
Billing must be enabled for activation of service(s)
'cloudbuild.googleapis.com,containerregistry.googleapis.com' to proceed.
```

What the? What's that even mean? Well, it turns out that firebase could use an
improvement in this error message with instructions on what to do next because
this part was a real pain honestly. But here's what you need to do...

### Step 11: Enable billing

So you'll go back to the firebase console for your project and navigate to
"Usage and billing" and then go to the "Details & settings" tab:

![Usage and billing settings page](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-11-usage-and-billing.png)

Then you'll click "Modify plan" and then "Select plan" under "Blaze Pay as you
go":

![Firebase billing plans](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033386/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-11-firebase-billing-plans.png)

Don't worry, Firebase has a generous free tier and (I don't think) you should be
charged for anything until you actually start using the function a lot. But at
this point it will have you set up a billing account at
[console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) so
you can have a credit card on file.

Once you have that figured out, then you can continue to actually deploy your
function.

### Step 12: Deploy locally (for real now)

Now that your account is configured for billing, you can try to deploy again:

```sh
firebase deploy
```

It will take a little bit of time, but when it's finally finished, you should
get output like this:

```sh
=== Deploying to '{your-project-id}'...

i  deploying functions
i  functions: ensuring required API cloudfunctions.googleapis.com is enabled...
i  functions: ensuring required API cloudbuild.googleapis.com is enabled...
✔  functions: required API cloudbuild.googleapis.com is enabled
✔  functions: required API cloudfunctions.googleapis.com is enabled
i  functions: preparing functions directory for uploading...
i  functions: packaged functions (23.46 KB) for uploading
✔  functions: functions folder uploaded successfully
i  functions: creating Node.js 12 function hello(us-central1)...
✔  functions[hello(us-central1)]: Successful create operation.
Function URL (hello): https://us-central1-{your-project-id}.cloudfunctions.net/hello

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/{your-project-id}/overview
```

And if you hit the endpoint they give you there, you should be able get your
function's output. For extra fun, our function handles providing a custom
subject, so if you add `?subject=Bob%20Ross` to the end of that URL, you get a
nice greeting. Hello there Bob Ross!

![Browser saying "Hello Bob Ross!"](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033386/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-12-deployed-fn-output.png)

### Step 13: Auto-deploy Firebase Cloud Functions with GitHub Actions

I don't know about you, but I don't like deploying from my local machine. I
prefer a continuous integration server to do that for me. Luckily, our project
is part of a GitHub repo and we can use GitHub actions to do this for us.

First, create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file and put this in it:

```yaml nonumber filename=.github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: ⎔ Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12

      - name: 📥 Download deps
        working-directory: functions
        run: npm install

      - name: 🚀 Deploy
        run: npx firebase-tools deploy --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN"
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

Here's what this does when you push the `main` branch (or `master` if you're
still using `master` as your default branch name):

1. Clones the repo
2. Installs Node v12
3. Installs dependencies via `npm` in the `functions` directory
4. Deploys to firebase using `firebase-tools` just like we did

For that last step it's doing a few things differently:

1. It's using `npx` so we don't have to worry about installing things globally
2. It's using the `--token` flag so we don't have to worry about logging in
3. It's exposing a `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable.

Let's get that firebase token set up.

### Step 14: Create a Firebase token for CI

Run this:

```sh
firebase login:ci
```

This will take you through the login process once again, when you've finished,
it will give you the token in the terminal output:

```sh
✔  Success! Use this token to login on a CI server:

1//06SeHVPB6AOF9CgYIARAAGAYSNwF-L9IrcdTvBfmn_ako1m3iJXRNpyV6tROQ193ZTGUtwLB95aoCC1l45ES40dRYfa5YjNCRxRc

Example: firebase deploy --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```

And don't even try using that token, I've already revoked it 😜 Get your own!

```sh
firebase logout --token 1//06SeHVPB6AOF9CgYIARAAGAYSNwF-L9IrcdTvBfmn_ako1m3iJXRNpyV6tROQ193ZTGUtwLB95aoCC1l45ES40dRYfa5YjNCRxRc
✔  Logged out token "1//06SeHVPB6AOF9CgYIARAAGAYSNwF-L9IrcdTvBfmn_ako1m3iJXRNpyV6tROQ193ZTGUtwLB95aoCC1l45ES40dRYfa5YjNCRxRc"
```

### Step 15: Add Firebase token to GitHub secrets

Great, now you'll copy that token into your GitHub repository's `secrets`
configuration:
`https://github.com/{your-username}/{your-repo-name}/settings/secrets/actions`

![GitHub secrets UI adding the firebase token](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1625033387/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/super-simple-start-to-firebase-functions/step-14-add-secret.png)

With that added, you're ready to deploy!

### Step 16: Commit and push

Now commit and push all of your changes:

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "firebase functions rock"
git push
```

Then go to your repo's actions page
(`https://github.com/{your-username}/{your-repo-name}/actions`) and watch the
deploy happen automatically!

Then celebrate 🎉
