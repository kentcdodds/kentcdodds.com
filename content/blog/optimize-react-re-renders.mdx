I was preparing a blog post on a subject related to React re-renders when I
stumbled upon this little React gem of knowledge I think you'll really
appreciate:

After reading this blog post,
[Brooks Lybrand](https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand) implemented this trick and
this was the result:

https://twitter.com/BrooksLybrand/status/1149800755404185609

Excited? Let's break it down with a simple contrived example and then talk about
what practical application this has for you in your day-to-day apps.

## An example

```tsx
// play with this on codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-codesandbox-g9mt5

import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function Logger(props) {
  console.log(`${props.label} rendered`)
  return null // what is returned here is irrelevant...
}

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>The count is {count}</button>
      <Logger label="counter" />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

When that's run, "counter rendered" will be logged to the console initially, and
each time the count is incremented, "counter rendered" will be logged to the
console. This happens because when the button is clicked, state changes and
React needs to get the new React elements to render based on that state change.
When it gets those new elements, it renders and commits them to the DOM.

Here's where things get interesting. Consider the fact that
`<Logger label="counter" />` never changes between renders. It's static, and
therefore could be extracted. Let's try that just for fun (I'm not recommending
you do this, wait for later in the blog post for practical recommendations).

```tsx
// play with this on codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-codesandbox-o9e9f

import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function Logger(props) {
  console.log(`${props.label} rendered`)
  return null // what is returned here is irrelevant...
}

function Counter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>The count is {count}</button>
      {props.logger}
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Counter logger={<Logger label="counter" />} />,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

Did you notice the change? Yeah! We get the initial log, but then we don't get
new logs when we click the button anymore! WHAAAAT!?

  does this mean for me" go ahead and [plop yourself down there now](#practical)
</callout-info>

## What's going on?

So what's causing this difference? Well, it has to do with React elements. Why
don't you take a quick break and read my blog post
["What is JSX?"](/blog/what-is-jsx) to get a quick refresher on React elements
and their relationship to JSX.

When React calls the counter function, it gets back something that looks a bit
like this:

```js
// some things removed for clarity
const counterElement = {
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: [
      {
        type: 'button',
        props: {
          onClick: increment, // this is the click handler function
          children: 'The count is 0',
        },
      },
      {
        type: Logger, // this is our logger component function
        props: {
          label: 'counter',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

These are called UI descriptor objects. They describe the UI that React should
create in the DOM (or via native components for react native). Let's click the
button and take a look at the changes:

```js [8,9]
const counterElement = {
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: [
      {
        type: 'button',
        props: {
          onClick: increment,
          children: 'The count is 1',
        },
      },
      {
        type: Logger,
        props: {
          label: 'counter',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

As far as we can tell, the only changes are the `onClick` and `children` props
of the `button` element. However, the entire thing is completely new! Since the
dawn of time using React, you've been creating these objects brand new on every
render. (Luckily, even mobile browsers are pretty fast at this, so that has
never been a significant performance problem).

It may actually be easier to investigate at the parts of this tree of React
elements is the same between renders, so here are the things that did NOT change
between those two renders:

```js [2,6,13,15]
const counterElement = {
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: [
      {
        type: 'button',
        props: {
          onClick: increment,
          children: 'The count is 1',
        },
      },
      {
        type: Logger,
        props: {
          label: 'counter',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

All the element types are the same (this is typical), and the `label` prop for
the Logger element is unchanged. However the props object itself changes every
render, even though the properties of that object are the same as the previous
props object.

**Ok, here's the kicker right here.** Because the Logger props object has
changed, React needs to re-run the Logger function to make sure that it doesn't
get any new JSX based on the new props object (in addition to effects that may
need to be run based on the props change). **But what if we could prevent the
props from changing between renders?** If the props don't change, then React
knows that our effects shouldn't need to be re-run and our JSX shouldn't change
([because React relies on the fact that our render methods should be idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning)).
This is exactly what React is coded to do
[right here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d420d2ccb6223a66d5e8fe824ac0d31ed5bf87a1/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2571-L2575)
and it's been that way since React first started!

Ok, but the problem is that
[react creates a brand new `props` object every time we create a React element](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/745baf2e061bdb7a07b511fa6fd8c1c5e8106313/packages/react/src/ReactElement.js#L177),
so how do we ensure that the props object doesn't change between renders?
Hopefully now you've got it and you understand why the second example above
wasn't re-rendering the Logger. If we create the JSX element once and re-use
that same one, then we'll get the same JSX every time!

## Let's bring it back together

Here's the second example again (so you don't have to scroll back up):

```tsx
// play with this on codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-codesandbox-o9e9f

import * as React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function Logger(props) {
  console.log(`${props.label} rendered`)
  return null // what is returned here is irrelevant...
}

function Counter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>The count is {count}</button>
      {props.logger}
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Counter logger={<Logger label="counter" />} />,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

So let's checkout the _things that are the same_ between renders:

```js [2,6,12-17]
const counterElement = {
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: [
      {
        type: 'button',
        props: {
          onClick: increment,
          children: 'The count is 1',
        },
      },
      {
        type: Logger,
        props: {
          label: 'counter',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Because the Logger element is completely unchanged (and therefore the props are
unchanged as well), React can automatically provide this optimization for us and
not bother re-rendering the Logger element because it shouldn't need to be
re-rendered anyway. This is basically like `React.memo` except instead of
checking each of the props individually, React is checking the props object
holistically.

<div style={{position: 'relative'}}>
  <a name="practical" style={{position: 'absolute', top: -100}} />
</div>

## So what does this mean for me?

In summary, if you're experiencing performance issues, try this:

1. "Lift" the expensive component to a parent where it will be rendered less
   often.
2. Then pass the expensive component down as a prop.

You may find doing so solves your performance problem without needing to spread
`React.memo` all over you codebase like a giant intrusive band-aid ðŸ¤•ðŸ˜‰

## Demo

Creating a practical demo of a slow app in React is tricky because it kinda
requires building a full app, but I do have a contrived example app that has a
before/after that you can check out and play with:

https://codesandbox.io/s/react-codesandbox-qtdob

<callout-warning class="aside">
  One thing I want to add is that even though it's _better_ to use the faster
  version of this code, it's still performing really badly when it renders
  initially and it would perform really badly if it ever actually needed to do
  another top-down re-render (or when you update the rows/columns). That's a
  performance problem that should probably be dealt with on its own merits
  (irrespective of how necessary the re-renders are). Also please remember that
  codesandbox uses the development version of React which gives you a really
  nice development experience, but performs WAY slower than the production
  version of React.
</callout-warning>

And this isn't just something that's useful at the top-level of your app either.
This could be applied to your app anywhere it makes sense. What I like about
this is that
["It's both natural for composition _and_ acts as an optimization opportunity."](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1143201204094341120)
(that was Dan). So I do this naturally and get the perf benefits for free. And
that's what I've always loved about React. **React is written so that idiomatic
React apps are fast by default, and then React provides optimization helpers for
you to use as escape hatches.**

Good luck!

<callout-info class="aside">
  I want to add a note that if you're using legacy context, you wont be able to
  get this optimization, [as React has a special case for that
  here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d420d2ccb6223a66d5e8fe824ac0d31ed5bf87a1/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2576),
  so people concerned about performance should probably migrate from legacy
  context.
</callout-info>
