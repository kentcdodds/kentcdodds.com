import * as C from './components'

When I was working on [`downshift`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift),
I came across a situation where my users (myself included) needed the ability to
at any time reset the dropdown we were building to its initial state: no input
value, nothing highlighted, nothing selected, closed. But I also had users who
wanted the "initial state" to have some default input, default selection, or
remain open. So I came up with the state initializers pattern to support all
these use cases.

The state initializer pattern allows you to expose an API to users to be able to
reset your component to its original state without having to completely unmount
and remount the component.

Actually, this pattern is similar in some ways to `defaultValue` in HTML.
Sometimes the consumer of your hook or component wants to initialize the value
of your state. The state initializer pattern allows you to do that.

Take this for example:

<div className="demo">
  <C.SimpleCounter />
</div>

```tsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  const reset = () => setCount(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

So our component has a way to initialize its state (to `0`) and it also
supports a way to reset the state to that initial value.

So what this pattern is for is to allow outside users of your component to
control that initial state value. For example. If someone wanted to start the
count off as `1` they might want to do this:

```tsx
<Counter initialCount={1} />
```

<callout-info class="aside">
  Some libraries that implement this pattern use the prefix `default` instead of
  `initial` to match the `defaultValue` from the `input` element. While this
  makes sense, I still prefer the prefix `initial` since I feel like it
  communicates the purpose and use case more clearly.
</callout-info>

To support the `initialCount` prop, here's all we need to do:

```tsx
function Counter({initialCount = 0}: {initialCount?: number}) {
  //              ^^^ accept the prop with a default value so it's optional
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount) // <-- pass it to your state
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  const reset = () => setCount(initialCount) // <-- pass that initialCount value to the reset function
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here's that with an initial count of `8`:

<div className="demo">
  <C.InitialCounterAlmostThere initialCount={8} />
</div>

That's the core bit for the pattern. But it is missing one important edge case.

What happens if the user of your component changes the value of `initialCount`
after your component is mounted? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the whole
"initial" part of our prop name? Here's an example of that where the consumer of
our count is changing the `initialCount` after the initial mount every 500ms:

<div className="demo">
  <C.BugReproduced />
</div>

Clicking "reset" above will reset our component to a different state from its
initial state which is probably a mistake, so we want that to not be possible.
Click it multiple times and it's getting reset to something completely different
every time. Now, I definitely agree with you. This is an example of someone
using the API wrong. But if it's not a lot of work we may as well make this
impossible right?

So, how can we grab hold of the actual initial value and ignore any changes to
that prop? I've got a hint for you. It's not so complicated as `useEffect` with
an `isMounted` boolean or whatever. It's actually pretty simple. And there are a
few ways we could do it:

```tsx
const {current: initialState} = React.useRef({count: initialCount})
const [initialState] = React.useState({count: initialCount})
const [initialState] = React.useReducer(s => s, {count: initialCount})

// actual initial count is: initialState.count
```

Between those options, I prefer the `useRef`, but you do you my friend. Let's do
it! Here's that with the `initialCount` set to `2`:

<div className="demo">
  <C.FinishedCounter initialCount={2} />
</div>

And even if someone were to randomly change the `initialCount` value, our
component wouldn't care.

## Resetting state via `key`

<callout-warning>
  If you've not already read [Understanding React's key
  prop](/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop), I recommend you give that a quick
  read right now. You done? Great, let's continue
</callout-warning>

One other thing I want to call out is you can actually reset a component pretty
easily without any API at all. It's a built-in React API for all components: the
`key` prop. Simply provide a `key` and set that `key` prop to a new value any
time you want to re-initialize the component. This will unmount and remount the
component brand new. Here's the code for that:

```tsx
function KeyPropReset() {
  const [key, setKey] = React.useState(0)
  const resetCounter = () => setKey(k => k + 1)
  return <KeyPropResetCounter key={key} reset={resetCounter} />
}

function Counter({reset}: {reset: () => void}) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <CountUI count={count} increment={increment} reset={reset} />
}
```

And here's that rendered:

<div className="demo">
  <C.KeyPropReset initialCount={10} />
</div>

You'll notice that we had to restructure the code a bit to support this. In some
situations that may not be possible/desireable.

Additionally, there are more implications to unmounting and remounting a
component (which is what changes to the `key` prop will do). For example, in my
Advanced React Patterns workshop, we've got an animation when state changes.
Check out the impact of the `key` approach on that:

**With the key reset approach** (notice there's no animation):

[![Clicking a toggle component, then a reset button which shows no animation on reset](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1636121505/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/the-state-initializer-pattern/key-reset.gif)](https://advanced-react-patterns-next.netlify.app/isolated/examples/resetting-via-key-prop.tsx)

**With the state initializer pattern** (notice there is an animation):

[![Clicking a toggle component, then a reset button which shows no animation on reset](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/v1636121497/kentcdodds.com/content/blog/the-state-initializer-pattern/state-initializer-pattern.gif)](https://advanced-react-patterns-next.netlify.app/isolated/final/05.extra-1.tsx)

Also unmounting and remounting components will call `useEffect` cleanups and
callbacks as well. That might be what you want, but it might not be.

## Conclusion

The state initializer pattern is pretty simple. In fact, for a long time I
removed it from my
[Advanced React Patterns](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/advanced-react-patterns)
workshop because I didn't think it was worth the time. But after a few times
delivering that workshop without it, people started asking me about the problems
it solves so I've added it back. Hope this post helps you in your work. Good
luck!
