When you sign up for an account on [kentcdodds.com](https://kentcdodds.com), you
can choose between the Red, Yellow, or Blue team. When you connect your KCD
account to your Discord account, your username will be set to the color of your
team and you'll have access to an exclusive Discord channel for your team.

To be honest, I'm not sure how far this team thing will go (I'm open to
suggestions), but I think we could do some fun stuff with it.

## Read Rankings

When you read a blog post, that's marked in the database and your team gets
points. Whichever team has the most points gets the highest ranking and "owns"
that blog post. You'll notice which team is winning based on the graph at the
top and bottom of the post as well as the highlight color throughout the post.
There's also an overall leader and that team color controls the color of the
blog page.

Because you can choose your own team, the teams can be different sizes, so we
don't just compute the teams by total number of blog post reads. Additionally,
you get credit for every time you read a blog post.

So here's how it works:

- A blog post is marked as "read" when you've scrolled through the whole thing
  and you've been on the page for long enough to have actually read it.
- For any given post, you get a recorded read every 7 days.
- The team ranking is computed by taking the total number of recent reads
  divided by the total number of active members.
- A team member is considered active if they've read a blog post in the last
  year.
- A read is considered "recent" if it was read within the last 6 months.

So there you go. That's what the ranking is all about.
