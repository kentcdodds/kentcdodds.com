- [Safco Products Vue Mesh Extended-Height Chair 3395BL](https://amazon.com/dp/B003L20OZ0/) -
  This is my chair. It's not terrific, but it's hard to find a chair that it's
  both comfortable and suited for a standing desk. (You'll probably want this
  [Safco Products Loop Arms Set](https://amazon.com/dp/B003L20OZU/))
- [Floortex Cleartex UltiMat Polycarbonate Chair Mat](https://amazon.com/dp/B000V4PPV4/) -
  My chair rolls around on this.
- [Imprint CumulusPRO Commercial Standing Desk Anti-Fatigue Mat](https://amazon.com/dp/B005UA2WO2/) -
  When I'm standing I put this on top of the chair mat. Otherwise I slide it to
  the side of my desk.

### Camera

- [Arkon Camera Wall Mount](https://amazon.com/dp/B00CMLX1O2/) - To mount my
  camera to the wall. This is really awesome.
- [Sony SEL-20F28 E-Mount 20mm F2.8 Prime Fixed Lens](https://amazon.com/dp/B00B20OYUO/) -
  A pancake lens with a nice balance of weight, size, aperture, and angle

  The light that shines in my face
- [Neewer Triangle Wall Mounting Boom Arm](https://amazon.com/dp/B06XWSFX6D/) -
  This is what I have the light mounted on. I'm able to push the light out of
  the way when I don't need it and I don't have anything cluttering the floor
  making my room nice and clean. I love this.
- [Manfrotto 156BLB 4-Feet Aluminum Mini Kit Stand with 015 Top (Black)](https://amazon.com/dp/B001D2GQ8Y/) -
  The stand I had for the light before I got the wall mount.

  This is my green screen that's mounted to the ceiling.
- [Bladelight (36")](https://www.flolight.com/bladelight-1/) - These light up
  the green screen super well. They're mounted inside the ceiling.

### Microphone

- [Shure SM7B Cardioid Dynamic Microphone](https://amazon.com/dp/B0002E4Z8M/) -
  This is a super nice microphone and gives fantastic quality. I see it in
  professional studios all the time.
- [Blue Microphones Compass Premium Tube-Style Microphone Broadcast Boom Arm With Internal Springs, Desktop Clamp and Built-in Cable Management](https://amazon.com/dp/B078MLBGRM/) -
  This is attached to my bookshelf (not my desk!!) and reaches in front of my
  left monitor to get to my mouth. I used to use the
  [Heil Sound Microphone Boom](https://amazon.com/dp/B004PJ414I/), but this
  one's much more stable.
- [Cloudlifter](https://amazon.com/dp/B004MQSV04/) - Boosts the power of my
  passive microphone. It's silly easy to use.
- [Audient EVO 4 USB Audio Interface](https://amazon.com/dp/B084BGC5LR) - This
  is the last place my microphone audio goes before it heads into my computer.
  (I used to use this and it was pretty good, but a bit quiet:
  [Pyle 2-Channel Audio Mixer](https://amazon.com/dp/B003CY6OHY/))
- [Audio-Technica Condenser Microphone (AT899)](https://amazon.com/dp/B000ZLQ3Y6) -
  I use this sometimes if I don't want a microphone in the shot when doing video
  of my face.

### Sound Proofing

[Watch me put this together](https://youtu.be/AwLj4qCyJ7E)

- [50 Pack Acoustic Panels 1" X 12" X 12", Black](https://amazon.com/dp/B07VDTR22R/) -
  Attached to cut versions of yard signs
- [10 Blank Signs White 18"x24"](https://amazon.com/dp/B07S952JN9/)
- [Gorilla Glue](https://amazon.com/dp/B07MWRV574/)
- [Command 4 lb White Picture Hanging Strips, Small](https://amazon.com/dp/B007RKFBT6/)
- [VersiFold Acoustical Room Divider](https://www.versare.com/shop/portable-partitions/acoustical-room-dividers/versifold-acoustical-room-divider.html) -
  I don't put this up very often, but I do have it in case I need a little extra
  sound proofing or I want to do a video and not have any distractions behind
  me.

## On the Go

- [KOPACK Lightweight Laptop Backpack](https://amazon.com/dp/B01FFA730Y/) - I
  love this backpack I bought another one as soon as the first was destroyed
  [in a onewheel accident](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1182010394300170240).
- [Power Bank 20100mAh Portable Charger](https://amazon.com/dp/B00X0GGLWM/) -
  This sits in my backpack and I can charge all my devices with it.
- [USB C Hub Multiport Adapter: Ethernet, HDMI, USB-3 and USB-C](https://amazon.com/dp/B07DW4TFJP/) -
  This stays in my backpack and I use it often when speaking at events or
  visiting people's offices.
- [Kensington Wireless Presenter with Red Laser Pointer](https://amazon.com/dp/B000FPGP4U/) -
  I've had this for years. I don't always use it, but when I need a laser
  pointer/wireless presenter tool, I'm glad I have it!
- [Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to VGA Adapter](https://amazon.com/dp/B00NH13I08/) -
  Wish I didn't need to just keep this around, but I do.

## Home Stuff

- [Yootech [2 Pack] Wireless Charger](https://amazon.com/dp/B07MSFFDNP/) - Where
  I put my phone on my desk. The other one goes on my nightstand.
- [AmpliFi HD WiFi System by Ubiquiti Labs](https://amazon.com/dp/B01L9O08PW/) -
  This thing gives super fast internet speed, a huge range of connectivity, and
  the range extenders are fantastic. I'll never bother with anything else again.
- [Synology 5 bay NAS DiskStation DS1019+](https://amazon.com/dp/B07NF9XDWG/) -
  I use this to store all of my pictures/movies/music/etc. It's amazing.
- [Seagate IronWolf 3.84TB NAS SSD Internal Solid State Drive](https://amazon.com/dp/B07R1P55GR/) -
  These are phenomenal SSDs for the NAS.
- [CORSAIR FORCE Series MP300 240GB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD Solid State Storage](https://amazon.com/dp/B07D98DZ38/) -
  I bought two of these when I had the HDDs. Now that I have SSDs I'm not sure
  they're necessary.
- [Seagate IronWolf 10TB NAS Internal Hard Drive HDD](https://amazon.com/dp/B07H241VK4/) -
  The SSDs are _super_ expensive, so if you want a cheaper alternative (and more
  space) get these. I swapped these for the SSDs because they make a little
  mechanical clicking noise as the arms move around the disk and we could
  literally hear it all over the house (we have pretty sensitive hearing) and it
  was keeping us up at night. If you don't think that'll bother you or you have
  a better sound-proofing strategy, then grab these.
