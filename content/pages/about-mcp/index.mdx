## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol for building AI agents that can
interact with external tools. Learn more about MCP from me on
[EpicAI.pro](https://www.epicai.pro).

## What can I do with the KCD MCP server?

The KCD MCP server is a tool that allows you to interact with the kentcdodds.com
website via your AI agent.

With this server, you can:

- Search for content on the site
- Subscribe to the newsletter
- Get the most popular blog posts

And if you're logged in, you can also:

- Get recommended blog posts for you
- Get and update information about your account

## How do I use it?

Install and configure the MCP client (e.g.
[Claude](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user),
[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/),
[Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol),
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)).

The MCP server is hosted at [kentcdodds.com/mcp](https://kentcdodds.com/mcp).
Here's configuration for Cursor:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"kentcdodds-com": {
			"url": "https://kentcdodds.com/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

If you have Claude Pro, Goose, or ChatGPT Plus, you can configure this with a UI
within those applications ("Integrations" for Claude, "Extensions" for Goose,
and "Connectors" for ChatGPT).
