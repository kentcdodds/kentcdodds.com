# Conferences

First of all, thanks for inviting me to speak at your conference. I take it as a
great honor!

Here are just a few random things I hope conference organizers take into account
during planning, preparation, and execution of any conference I attend. In no
particular order.

<callout-muted class="aside">
  I realize that some of these things may be too much to ask from community-led
  events and things, but hopefully these can give you an idea of what would
  really make your speakers happy.
</callout-muted>

## Diversity of Speakers

I come from a very well represented group of people (white men). I will not
speak at your event if everyone else looks like me. Please put in the work to
diversify your speaker lineup.

## Parties/Events that are actually fun

Some people really enjoy drinking alchohol and yelling at each other all night.
I am not one of those people. I don't drink alchohol and I don't like yelling
over loud music to communicate. I go to conferences to meet people and share
ideas. If you really want to have the drunken yelling match type party then
that's your choice, but it would be awesome to have another place for people
like me to be to have meaningful conversations.

Some conferences have a separate room with board games, milkshakes, etc. That's
perfect. Gives us something to do to break the ice and a space where we can just
enjoy each other's company.

Sometimes there will be a hackathon or something which I will probably not
participate in, but I've definitely enjoyed in the past.

## Calendar Event Invites

When preparing for an event, I get countless emails telling me where to be and
when for different activities and things. Please don't force me to manually
enter this into my calendar. 99% of the time your speakers all use digital
calendars (and most probably use Google Calendar). Please send a digital
calendar invitation for every when/where event going on for the conference. It
helps a great deal (this includes hotel checkin/checkout time with confirmation
numbers). And _please_ include the physical address in the location and details
in the description.

## Honorarium

For events that rake in a lot of money, I expect to be compensated for the time
and effort I put into preparing and delivering my talk. I'm often cited as a
reason people bought a ticket to come to the conference and I expect that value
to be recognized for events where the organizers are making money.

Many event organizers are community-led events that are just trying break even
if they can. If you're on a very tight budget and struggling to get
sponsors/ticket sales, talk to me and I may be able to waive the honorarium for
you. If I agree to come, then it's because I appreciate what you're doing for
the community and want to support you.

## Air Travel

I prefer to schedule my own flights and get reimbursed for them. If that's
overly complicated for you then I'm fine scheduling through an agency as well.

One other thing to keep in mind is that I don't plan to stick around for much
site-seeing after the conference. When I travel I leave my wife at home alone
with four kids and I want to get back to them as soon as possible. This might
mean I miss out on some or part of the after-conference activities which is a
bummer, but it is what it is. Eventually I'll bring some or all of my family
along with me on these trips and will stick around longer ðŸ˜„

## International Travel

I really struggle when traveling internationally. Paying extra to fly first
class makes a big difference on my ability to recover and deliver for you and
your attendees. If you're making money on this event, then I will expect you to
cover the cost. For community-led events that are just trying to break even, I
realize this puts me out of reach for your event. So we can make up for this by
hosting a workshop to pay for my travel as well as my time to deliver the
workshop.

I will also need a day to recover from the trip. So I generally prefer to have
at least 24 hours (preferrably more) between the time that I land and the time
I'm expected to do anything for the conference. This obviously has implications
on my sleeping accomodations...

## Hotel

I prefer that you book the hotel(s) for me during my stay. You know more about
the area and most of the time conferences have a special bulk rate anyway.
Please send me confirmation details as soon as you have them (along with a
calendar event for checkin/checkout time).

## Gifts

Who doesn't love gifts? Especially when traveling internationally, having
something unique to the location I'm traveling to is appreciated. I definitely
appreciate it. Gifts are a kind gesture that is certainly not expected and I
won't be let down if I don't get one. If you do want to give your speakers a
gift, here are some things to keep in mind (at least for me).

Please keep in mind that I typically don't check baggage and pack light, so I
can't take anything very large. Also coffee/tea related gifts are pretty popular
but they don't work for me since I don't drink coffee or tea. And I've had an
unfortunate number of jam-like products confiscated at airport security as well,
so make sure whatever you give is something I can travel with.

If you'd like to provide a gift, but you're uncertain of what to offer, donation
to a local charity in my name is deeply appreciated and doesn't bring with it
logistical challenges as well.

## Talk Recordings

I prefer talks I give to be recorded and made available on YouTube promptly
after the event. If you record it but don't make it available on your own
YouTube channel then I would like to be able to upload it to mine.

Even better if there's a live stream so my family can watch at home.

## Speaker Requirements

When I'm invited to speak, I need to know these things:

- What topic do you want me to speak on?
- What's the intended audience like for my talk and how many people do you
  expect to be there?
- How long is my speaking time?
- What time is my speaking slot? (Remember, calendar events are appreciated)
- Will there be Q&A? (I prefer no, but I'm fine if so).
- When can I do a tech-check?
- What screen resolution will I have?
- Can I use my own laptop, if so, will we be using HDMI? Will computer audio be
  supported?
- Where do I go after my talk is finished?
- Is there a speaker's lounge? Where is it?
- If my talk starts late, can I still speak the full-length? Will there be a
  countdown clock that starts when I start speaking (yes please)?

## Code of Conduct

I expect a code of conduct to be well advertised and enforced at every event I
attend.

## Conclusion

If you have questions of things I haven't covered in this document, please
[contact me](/contact) and I'll get it added. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff.
Thanks for the invitation!
