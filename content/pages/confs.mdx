# Conferences

First of all, thanks for inviting me to speak at your conference. I take it as a
great honor!

I travel a lot and need to be picky about the events I decide to attend. I am
regularly told by attendees that they only decided to buy a ticket to the
conference because I was speaking at it, so I try hard to live up to that
expectation. I also do my best to market the event to my audience to help get
people to come.

Here are just a few things I hope conference organizers take into account during
planning, preparation, and execution of any conference I attend. In no
particular order.

## Info

You can find all the information about my bio, photos, etc. on
[my info page](/info).

## Diversity of Speakers

I come from a very well represented group of people (white men). I will not
speak at your event if everyone else looks like me. Please put in the work to
diversify your speaker lineup.

## Parties/Events that are actually fun

Some people really enjoy drinking alcohol and yelling at each other all night. I
am not one of those people. I don't drink alcohol and I don't like yelling over
loud music to communicate. I go to conferences to meet people and share ideas.
If you really want to have the drunken yelling match type party then that's your
choice, but it would be awesome to have another place for people like me to be
to have meaningful conversations.

Some conferences have a separate room with board games, milkshakes, etc. That's
perfect. Gives us something to do to break the ice and a space where we can just
enjoy each other's company.

Sometimes there will be a hackathon or something which I will probably not
participate in, but I've definitely enjoyed in the past.

## Calendar Event Invites

When preparing for an event, I get countless emails telling me where to be and
when for different activities and things. Please don't force me to manually
enter this into my calendar. 99% of the time your speakers all use digital
calendars (and most probably use Google Calendar). Please send a digital
calendar invitation for every when/where event going on for the conference. It
helps a great deal (this includes hotel checkin/checkout time with confirmation
numbers). And _please_ include the physical address in the location and details
in the description.

## Honorarium

I expect to be compensated for the time and effort I put into preparing and
delivering my talk. I'm often cited as a reason people bought a ticket to come
to the conference and I expect that value to be recognized for events where the
organizers are making money.

Many event organizers are community-led events that are just trying break even
if they can. If you're on a very tight budget and struggling to get
sponsors/ticket sales, talk to me and I may be able to waive the honorarium for
you. If I agree to come, then it's because I appreciate what you're doing for
the community and want to support you.

<callout-info>
  I expect conferences to pay for all of the speakers' conference ticket,
  flights, hotel, and domestic travel because otherwise the speaker pool is
  limited to only those who can afford to travel. I don't attend conferences
  which do not pay for these things for speakers.
</callout-info>

## Air Travel

I prefer to schedule my own flights and get reimbursed for them. Reimbursement
transfers are cheapest for you and easiest for both of us if you use
[wise.com](https://wise.com). PayPal is also fine (though it can be expensive
for you). If that's overly complicated, then I'm fine scheduling through an
agency as well.

One other thing to keep in mind is that I don't plan to stick around for much
site-seeing after the conference. When I travel I leave my wife at home alone
with four kids and I want to get back to them as soon as possible. This might
mean I miss out on some or part of the after-conference activities which is a
bummer, but it is what it is. Eventually I'll bring some or all of my family
along with me on these trips and will stick around longer 😄

I expect a first class ticket for my international travel. Business class is
fine for domestic travel. Also, for international travel I need a day to recover
from the trip. So I prefer to have around 24 hours between the time that I land
and the time I'm expected to do anything for the conference. Please plan my
hotel accommodations accordingly.

## Hotel

I prefer that you book the hotel(s) for me during my stay. You know more about
the area and most of the time conferences have a special bulk rate anyway.
Please send me confirmation details as soon as you have them (along with a
calendar event for checkin/checkout time).

I do prefer that the hotel be close to the conference venue if possible.

## Gifts

Who doesn't love gifts? Especially when traveling internationally, having
something unique to the location I'm traveling to is appreciated. I definitely
appreciate it. Gifts are a kind gesture that is certainly not expected and I
won't be let down if I don't get one. If you do want to give your speakers a
gift, here are some things to keep in mind (at least for me).

Please keep in mind that I typically don't check baggage and pack light, so I
can't take anything very large. Also coffee/tea related gifts are pretty popular
but they don't work for me since I don't drink coffee or tea. And I've had an
unfortunate number of jam-like products confiscated at airport security as well,
so make sure whatever you give is something I can travel with.

If you'd like to provide a gift, but you're uncertain of what to offer, donation
to a local charity in my name is deeply appreciated and doesn't bring with it
logistical challenges.

## Talk Recordings

I expect talks I give to be recorded and made available on YouTube promptly
after the event. If you record it but don't make it available on your own
YouTube channel then I would like to be able to upload it to mine.

Even better if there's a live stream so my family can watch at home.

## Workshops

I'm generally happy to conduct workshops at conferences (see my list of workshop
topics on my [`/workshops`](/workshops) page). Workshop tickets should be
between $300-$600 per person per day. I'll let you choose an appropriate price
for your part of the world. I expect to receive 60% of the post-expenses revenue
or 40% of the pre-expenses revenue. I'll let you choose which one you prefer.

Most often my workshops sell quite well, but please do keep me in the loop of
ticket sales either way. If we haven't sold more than 7 tickets two weeks before
the event then let's talk about canceling the workshop, refunding attendees, and
changing my travel plans.

The workshop should **not** be recorded without approving it with me first.

I expect all the regular things you'd need for a workshop like:

- A projector everyone can comfortably see
- A podium I can stand at with a stool I can sit on
- Tables and power for attendees
- Coffee and snacks throughout the day
- Lunch that is included in the ticket price

## Speaker Requirements

When I'm invited to speak, I need to know these things:

- What topic do you want me to speak on? For keynotes we need to discuss the
  needs of your audience and what I am currently excited about and how to get
  those two things to align.
- What's the intended audience like for my talk and how many people do you
  expect to be there?
- How long is my speaking time?
- What time is my speaking slot? (Remember, calendar events are appreciated)
- Will there be Q&A? (I prefer no, but I'm fine if so).
- When can I do a tech-check?
- What screen resolution will I have?
- Can I use my own laptop, if so, will we be using HDMI? Will computer audio be
  supported?
- Where do I go after my talk is finished?
- Is there a speaker's lounge? Where is it?
- If my talk starts late, can I still speak the full-length? Will there be a
  countdown clock that starts when I start speaking (yes please)?

## Code of Conduct

I expect a code of conduct to be well advertised and enforced at every event I
attend.

## Chat

Connecting with attendees during the conference is a lot of help. A twitter
hashtag is great. A discord server is awesome. A conference app is "meh" for me
personally, but some people really like it (a capable website is better).

## Badges

Please make sure that people's names are clearly visible on the both the front
and back of badges/lanyards.

A cool idea I implemented for [Remix Conf](https://remix.run/conf) is to allow
people to provide their social avatar for printing directly on the badge. For a
lot of people, I recognize their twitter avatar better than their name or face,
so it would help me know whether I've digitally met the person I'm talking to.

Another idea is try to avoid those annoying badges that make a tinkly sound
whenever they move. Otherwise while the speaker is talking you'll think
someone is playing jingle bells.

## Conclusion

If you have questions of things I haven't covered in this document, please
[contact me](/contact) and I'll get it added. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff.
Thanks for the invitation!
