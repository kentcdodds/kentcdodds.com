# KCD Style Guide

- I'm a fan of [AHA Programming](https://kcd.im/aha). I'd much rather ship
  duplication than premature abstractions.
- In TypeScript, avoid type assertions (known as type casts in other languages)
  via the `as` operator if possible.
- We're shooting for 100s on the lighthouse score rankings.
- If I don't have an ESLint rule for it, then I'm not allowed to nit-pick on
  code style. This doesn't mean I won't nit-pick anyway. It just means you can
  tell me to write an ESLint rule if it matters that much to me ðŸ˜…
- Lean on TypeScript inference. Avoid implicit any.

I'm sure there's tons more I could put here, but I gotta go ðŸ˜…
