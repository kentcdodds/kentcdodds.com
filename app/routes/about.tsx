            Early on in my career I decided I wanted to be an expert in
            JavaScript. So I set my mind on mastering the world's most popular
            programming language. I spent countless hours writing JavaScript
            for the companies I worked for as well as in the evenings for open
            source and other side projects. Eventually I even represented PayPal
            on the TC-39 (the committee responsible for standardizing the
            JavaScript language). I feel like I achieved my goal of becoming an
            expert in JavaScript, but I do need to keep up just like everyone
            else, which is an enjoyable challenge.

            I've also always been excited about sharing what I know with others.
            When I was in school, I signed up to be a tutor for my classmates
            and once I even got Firebase to sponsor pizza for me to give an
            informal workshop about Angular.js to my fellow students. I was a
            speaker at the first meetup I ever attended, and I've now delivered
            over a hundred talks on topics including JavaScript, React, Testing,
            Careers, and more. One of my talks got noticed by egghead and I was
            invited to turn that talk into an egghead course. The rest is
            history!

              One of the biggest things that has helped me learn is by
              committing myself to sharing what I know with others. Between
              podcasts, blog posts, talks, and workshops, I force myself into
              situations where I have to be accountable to those I'm teaching
              to really know my stuff. And as a result, a lot of people have
              learned from me as well.
