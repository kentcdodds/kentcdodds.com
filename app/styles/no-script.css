/*
We animate in some stuff with framer-motion and a bunch of our elements use
framer-motion to animate hover/focus states. This works great and looks nice,
but if JavaScript is disabled things could be invisible or not accessible.
This file is included in a <noscript> tag in the head of the page so the page
will work if JavaScript is disabled.

The only real time JavaScript will be disabled on our site is when people want
to test the claim that it works without JavaScript ðŸ˜†.

So let's make it work without JavaScript as much as possible.
